Firstly, according to the social force theory, we constructed individuals' moving velocities based on their expectations. Secondly, made an adjacent test to generate the nearer neighbors as emotional contagions usually occurred between neighbors. And then we treated the emotional contagions between individuals and their neighbors as the information spreading process so that we calculated the influences on their moving directions through the emotional information spreading model SIR (Susceptible Infective Removal). Social force for simulating moving individuals and SIR model were adopted by our method to simulate the emotional contagion of the crowd.

We use Twitter streams to monitor the spread of these phenomena through human social and information networks. This system, the contagion monitor, parses Twitter posts to identify emerging phenomena, as captured in hashtags, URLs, words and phrases, or account-handles, and then determines the extent to which a particular phenomenon spreads via the social network (in contrast to its spread via news broadcasts or independent adoption) and locates the contagion within Twitter communities. The monitor approximates the adoption threshold of a social contagion by measuring the fraction of Twitter users who were “infected” by the contagion (e.g., joined a particular social movement) after more than one of their friends had done so. Finally, the monitor makes a judgment about whether the phenomenon has reached critical mass, which is defined as the point where a social contagion begins spreading rapidly and breaches the social boundaries of its early adopter group. We test our prototype monitor on two data sources - an ongoing stream of tweets grouped by user-added hashtags and a collection of posts by a monitored set of Nigerian Twitter users - before productionalizing. We use the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform to evaluate the performance on both data sources. In both cases, we find that our approach successfully distinguishes between high-threshold and low-threshold social contagions.","2473-991X","978-1-7281-1056-1","10.1109/ASONAM49781.2020.9381313","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9381313","","Social networking (online);Blogs;Prototypes;Data mining;Monitoring","social networking (online);text analysis","social movements;human social networks;social contagion monitoring;information networks;Twitter post parsing;user added hashtags;Amazon Mechanical Turk platform","","","","24","","24 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These social media produce vast information every day and support diverse social contagions. However, the dynamics and mechanisms of these social contagions are still obscure and unrevealed because of the big data. In this paper, we propose a novel non-Markovian social contagion model to study behavior spreading under the environment of big data, in which a fraction of global individuals can transmit the behavior information to every susceptible individual, and the remaining local individuals can only transmit the behavior information to neighbors. Through extensive numerical simulations, we find that the global individuals markedly promote the behavior spreading and decrease the critical information transmission probability. In addition, we note that the degree heterogeneity of social network does not change the phenomena qualitatively. Our results may shed some lights in predicting and controlling social contagions. In further, the proposed model may be applied in real simulation platforms for emergency management in big data era.","","978-1-4673-8979-2","10.1109/IAEAC.2017.8054131","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8054131","complex networks;social contagions;behavior spreading;simulation model","Social network services;Big Data;Numerical models;Data models;Numerical simulation;Information processing;Erbium","Big Data;emergency management;social networking (online)","big data era;social medium;social media;novel nonMarkovian social contagion model;behavior information;susceptible individual;critical information transmission probability;social network;Facebook;Twitter;microblog;social contagions;emergency management","","2","","20","","2 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Key players, which are typically high-degree, -k-core or -centrality agents in a networked population, are considered important for spreading social contagions. In this paper, we ask whether contagions can propagate through a population that is void of key players. We use Erdos-Renyi random graphs as a representation of unstructured populations that lack key players, and investigate whether complex contagions - those requiring reinforcement - can spread on them. We demonstrate that two game-theoretic contagion models that utilize common knowledge for collective action can readily spread such contagions, which is a significant difference from classic complex contagion models. We compare contagion dynamics results on unstructured networks to those on more typically-studied, structured social networks to understand the role of network structure. We test a total of 14 networks. The two common knowledge models are also contrasted to understand the effects of different modeling assumptions on dynamics. We show that under a wide range of conditions, these two models produce markedly different results.","","978-1-5090-6164-8","10.1109/BESC.2016.7804473","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7804473","common knowledge;collective action;key players;social modeling;complex contagion","Erbium;Sociology;Statistics;Facebook;Knowledge engineering;Context modeling","game theory;graph theory;graphs;social networking (online)","social contagion spread;social behavior;information diffusion;social influence;collective action;networked population;Erdos-Renyi random graphs;game-theoretic contagion models;complex contagion models;contagion dynamics;unstructured networks;structured social networks;network structure;modeling","","3","","22","","5 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Because cheating users boast an abnormal thus conspicuous degree of success, it has a strong chance of being noticed by their friends and leading them to cheat themselves. To detect and prevent cheating, it is beneficial to understand this dynamic as a contagion problem. In this paper, we show the existence of the contagion of cheating.

We formulate various problems to minimize contagion spread and show that some are efficiently solvable while others are formally hard. We also compare our hardness results to those from node blocking problems and show interesting differences between the two. Our main problem is not only hard, but also has no approximation guarantee, unless P=NP. Therefore, we devise a heuristic for the problem and compare its performance to state-of-the-art heuristics from the literature. We show, through results of 12 (network, heuristic) combinations on three real social networks, that our method offers considerable improvement in the ability to block contagions in weighted and unweighted networks.

We argue that these problems can be alleviated with dynamic view, which assumes logit responses by strategic agents with utilities quantifying multiple competing incentives.

However, the effects of the heterogeneous adoption thresholds on complex contagions in weighted networks have not been systematically investigated. In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous complex contagion model on the weighted network, in which individuals have different adoption thresholds. For individuals with a relatively small adoption threshold, they are more likely to adopt the contagion and act as activists. An edge-weight based compartmental theory is developed to unveil spreading dynamics. Through extensive numerical simulations and theoretical analysis, we find that, for any weight distribution heterogeneity, with the increase of the activist fraction, the growth pattern of the final adoption size versus the information spreading probability changes from hybrid phase transition to a second-order continuous phase transition. Meanwhile, increasing the activist fraction can promote behavior spreading. Through bifurcation analysis, we discover that changing the heterogeneity of the weight distribution will not change the type of phase transition. Besides, reducing weight distribution heterogeneity can facilitate behavior spreading. Extensive numerical simulations verify that the theoretical solutions coincide with the numerical results very well.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2984615","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61801044,61803106); China Postdoctoral Science Special Foundation(grant numbers:2019T120829); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (CPSF)(grant numbers:2018M631073); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Sichuan Science and Technology Program(grant numbers:20YYJC4001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9051808","Complex contagions;heterogeneous adoption;weighted networks;threshold model;compartmental theory","Social networking (online);Numerical models;Numerical simulation;Information processing;Epidemics;Correlation;Complex networks","bifurcation;network theory (graphs);probability;social network theory;social sciences","bifurcation analysis;information spreading probability;behavior spreading;second-order continuous phase transition;activist fraction;weight distribution heterogeneity;edge-weight based compartmental theory;heterogeneous complex contagion model;network science;complex contagions;adoption threshold heterogeneity;weighted network;complex social contagions","","","","55","CCBY","31 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Finally, we use a data-driven approach to propose a player typology based on degree of socialization and analyze churn behavior among these player types. Experimental results show that the loner player type is much more likely to churn than the socializer player types and as the degree of socialization decreases among socializers, the propensity to churn increases.","2473-991X","978-1-4503-6868-1","10.1145/3341161.3344378","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9072978","churn;social contagion;supervised learning;clustering;player typology","Games;Social network services;Supervised learning;Indexes;Computer science;Predictive models;Information technology","computer games;pattern classification;social sciences computing;supervised learning","virtual environments;player churn;social contagion;MMORPG game;activity behavior;player typology;loner player type;socializer player types;massively multiplayer online role-playing games;node churn behavior;supervised learning framework;classification models;data-driven approach","","","","40","","23 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It emerges from the hypothesis that the behavior of the Emotional Contagion phenomenon can be modeled similarly to disease proliferation, considering Empathy as its main factor. We propose a social simulation model for emotional contagion, considering that the probability of one adopting others' emotions can derive from the empathy level of the individual, which is obtained through the Empathy Quotient score. The population sample of virtual agents is randomly generated following a normal distribution, which can be formed either by individuals without empathy limitations, or by Asperger Syndrome or High-Functioning Autism patients.

This paper focuses on presenting a new framework for analyzing and detracting negative emotional contagion through the use of clustering for detecting the community where the negative emotions may spread. Also, classification of nodes in the network is used to analyze the negativity in the nodes to help decide on the best treatment. Moreover, Prominent Actors (PAs) in the network must be determined to help in the treatment. Finally, through the use of recommender system and positive contagion the best treatment will be introduced.

The effect of these interventions was analysed by simulating the diffusion of emotional values about intentions and goals in a social network. Experiments showed that changing connections closer to the target have a larger influence than changing connections further from the target node. A comparison of the effect of the proposed interventions with all possible interventions showed that they are among the most optimal possible interventions.

In these games, a mitigator attempts to minimize the efforts of an influencer to spread his agenda across a social network. Previous work has assumed that the influence graph structure is known with certainty by both players. However, in reality, there is often significant information asymmetry between the mitigator and the influencer. We introduce a model of this information asymmetry as a two-player zero-sum Bayesian game. Nearly all past work in influence maximization and social network analysis suggests that graph structure is fundamental in strategy generation, leading to an expectation that solving the Bayesian game exactly is crucial. Surprisingly, we show through extensive experimentation on synthetic and real-world social networks that many common forms of uncertainty can be addressed near optimally by ignoring the vast majority of it and simply solving an abstracted game with a few randomly chosen types. This suggests that optimal strategies of games that do not model the full range of uncertainty in influence blocking games are typically robust to uncertainty about the influence graph structure.","","978-0-7695-5137-1","10.1109/SocialCom.2013.11","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6693308","Game theory;Social contagion;Influence maximization","Uncertainty;Games;Bayes methods;Social network services;Communities;Computational modeling;Silicon","Bayes methods;game theory;security;social networking (online)","Bayesian security games;controlling contagion;influence blocking games;adversarial domain modeling;counterinsurgency;influence graph structure;information asymmetry;mitigator;influencer;two player zero sum Bayesian game;influence maximization;social network analysis;strategy generation;social networks;abstracted game;optimal strategies;uncertainty","","21","","22","","2 Jan 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By merging this with the Device-to-Device communication (D2D), we originate a new paradigm presented in this work. We propose a novel bio-inspired approach for quantifying the impact of the social multiplex structure on D2D contents' dissemination. Through rigorous mathematical modelling, we have shaped the D2D data dissemination process as a social contagion dynamics of two co-evolving spreading processes. We weigh the dynamic interactions by including the concepts of homophily and awareness. We have measured the effect of homophily, awareness and network heterogeneity on information diffusion. The bio-inspired mechanism is evaluated through a rigorous mathematical and algorithm analysis, and a meaningful simulation. We show that this mechanism is effective in tuning network awareness and alertness, breaking the “echo chambers” effect.

To this end, we propose a novel non-Markovian social contagion model, in which individuals obtain the behavioral information not only from their neighbors but also from the mass medias. Through extensive numerical simulations, we find that the mass medias promote the adoption of behavior, and decrease the critical behavioral information transmission probability. In addition, we also note that the heterogeneity of degree distribution promotes the behavior adoption.","","978-1-5090-4093-3","10.1109/FSKD.2016.7603192","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7603192","","Entertainment industry;Media;Erbium;Information processing;Color;Complex networks;Biological system modeling","behavioural sciences;behavioural sciences computing;probability;social networking (online)","mass medias;nonMarkovian social contagion model;numerical simulation;critical behavioral information transmission probability;degree distribution heterogeneity","","","","26","","24 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address these questions, we developed a nonexperimental, noninvasive method to detect and quantify contagion of semantic expression in massive online social networks, which we review and discuss here. Using only observational data, the method avoids performing emotional experiments on users of online social networks, a research practice that recently became an object of criticism and concern. Our model combines geographic aggregation and instrumental variables regression to measure the effect of an exogenous variable on an individual's expression and the influence of this change on the expression of others to whom that individual is socially connected. In a previous work, we applied our method to the emotional content of posts generated by a large sample of users over a period of three years. Those results suggest that each post expressing a positive or negative emotion can cause friends to generate one to two additional posts expressing the same emotion, and it also inhibits their use of the opposite emotion. Here, we generalize our method so it can be applied to contexts different than emotional expression and to different forms of content generated by the users of online platforms. The method allows us to determine the usage of words in the same semantic category spread, and to estimate a signed relationship between different semantic categories, showing that an increase in the usage of one category alters the usage of another category in one's social contacts. Finally, it also allows us to estimate the total cumulative effect that a person has on all of her social contacts.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2014.2366052","Army Research Office (ARO)(grant numbers:W911NF-11-1-0363); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6955798","Influence;instrumental variables;nonexperimental methods;semantic expression;social networks;Influence;instrumental variables;nonexperimental methods;semantic expression;social networks","Semantics;Social network services;Urban areas;Context modeling;Internet;Mathematical model;Complex networks","human factors;psychology;regression analysis;social networking (online)","noninvasive detection method;emotional contagion;online social networks;semantic expression;geographic aggregation;instrumental variable regression;social contacts","","11","","58","IEEE","13 Nov 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It shows that people’s interests are organized in clusters around different topics, but the rising of an extraordinary emergency event, as the coronavirus disease epidemics, channels the people’s attention into a more homogenized structure, shifting it as triggered by a non-random collective process. The connectedness of networked individuals, on multiple social levels, impacts on the attention, representing a tuning element of different behavioural outcomes, changing the awareness diffusion enough to produce effects on epidemics spreading. We propose a mathematical framework to model the interplay between the collective attention and the co-evolving processes of awareness diffusion, modelled as a social contagion phenomenon, and epidemic spreading on weighted multiplex networks. Our proposed modeling approach structures a systematically understanding as a social network marker of interdependent collective dynamics through the introduction of the multiplex dimension of both networked individuals and topics, quantifying the role of human-related factors, as homophily, network properties, and heterogeneity. We introduce a data-driven approach by integrating different types of data, digitally traced as user-generated data from Twitter and Google Trends, in response to an extraordinary emergency event as coronavirus disease. Our findings demonstrate how the proposed model allows us to quantify the reaction of the collective attention, proving that it can represent a social predictive marker of the awareness dynamics, unveiling the impact on epidemic spreading, for a timely crisis response planning.

In this paper, we study the contagion adoption behavior under a set of interactions, specifically, the interactions among users, contagions' contents, and sentiments, which are learned from social network structures and texts. We develop an effective and efficient interaction-aware diffusion (IAD) framework, incorporating these interactions into a unified model. We also present a generative process to distinguish user roles, a co-training method to determine contagions' categories and a new topic model to obtain topic-specific sentiments. Evaluation on the large-scale Weibo dataset demonstrates that our proposal can learn how different users, contagion categories, and sentiments interact with each other efficiently. With these interactions, we can make a more accurate prediction than the state-of-art baselines.

Moreover, in real-world scenarios multiple contagions spread through the network simultaneously. These contagions not only propagate at the same time but they also interact and compete with each other as they spread over the network. While traditional empirical studies and models of diffusion consider individual contagions as independent and thus spreading in isolation, we study how different contagions interact with each other as they spread through the network. We develop a statistical model that allows for competition as well as cooperation of different contagions in information diffusion. Competing contagions decrease each other's probability of spreading, while cooperating contagions help each other in being adopted throughout the network. We evaluate our model on 18,000 contagions simultaneously spreading through the Twitter network. Our model learns how different contagions interact with each other and then uses these interactions to more accurately predict the diffusion of a contagion through the network. Moreover, the model also provides a compelling hypothesis for the principles that govern content interaction in information diffusion. Most importantly, we find very strong effects of interactions between contagions.

Social media are drastically increasing and have become one of the most critical media for people interactions. According to psychological researches, one's emotion diffuses across interacting people. Furthermore, emotion affects people's opinion. The emotion contagion also happens through social media via the users' posts and affects the readers. Therefore, emotion is an essential element in opinion formation models in a social network which has attracted little attention. In this paper, we show how considering emotion in opinion formation model for online social networks improves the model. We have used a dataset containing some debates from the CreateDebate.com website. Two classifiers, with and without considering emotions, have been implemented based on the social impact model of opinion formation to predict the stances of the users' next post in the dataset and the results have been compared with the dataset. The experiment results lead us to conclude that considering emotions improves the accuracy and precision of the social impact model of opinion formation in social media.","","978-1-7281-1431-6","10.1109/ICWR.2019.8765288","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8765288","social media;opinion formation;social impact model;emotion;classification","Biological system modeling;Social networking (online);Computational modeling;Mathematical model;Psychology;Predictive models;Market research","pattern classification;psychology;social networking (online);social sciences computing","social media;opinion formation model;people interactions;emotion contagion;online social networks;social impact model;psychological research;createdebate.com website;pattern classification","","3","","38","","18 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, recent literature shows that some attributes are more correlated between two-hop neighbors, a concept referred to as monophily. This motivates us to explore monophilic contagion, the case where a contagion (e.g., a product, disease) is adopted by considering two-hop neighbors instead of immediate neighbors (e.g., you ask your friend about the new iPhone and she recommends you the opinion of one of her friends). We show that the phenomenon named friendship paradox makes it easier for the monophilic contagion to spread widely. We also consider the case where the underlying network stochastically evolves in response to the state of the contagion (e.g., depending on the severity of a flu virus, people restrict their interactions with others to avoid getting infected) and show that the dynamics of such a process can be approximated by a differential equation whose trajectory satisfies an algebraic constraint restricting it to a manifold. Our results shed light on how graph theoretic consequences affect contagions and, provide simple deterministic models to approximate the collective dynamics of contagions over stochastic graph processes.","2327-4697","","10.1109/TNSE.2019.2909015","Army Research Office(grant numbers:W911NF-17-1-0335); National Science Foundation(grant numbers:1714180); Air Force Office of Scientific Research(grant numbers:FA9550-18-1-0007); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8680709","Friendship paradox;diffusion;SIS model;social networks;monophily;reactive network;random graphs.","Diffusion processes;Social networking (online);Mathematical model;Adaptation models;Analytical models;Diseases;Sociology","complex networks;network theory (graphs);social network theory;stochastic processes","social networks;monophilic contagion;reactive networks;SIS diffusion processes;two-hop neighbors;friendship paradox","","6","","55","IEEE","2 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Almost two years after start the pandemic, it is necessary to collect and synthesize the existing work on this matter. This work focuses on studies related to the COVID-19 contagion simulation through transport networks. In particular, we are specially interested in the different datasets and epidemiological models used. The search methodology consists of four exhaustive searches in Google Scholar carried out between January 2020 and January 2021. Of the 1786 findings, we chose 53 articles related to Covid-19 contagion modeling and simulation through transport networks. The results show 30 different data sources for the collection of air flights and 11 additional sources for maritime and land transport. These datasets are usually complemented with other data sources, local and international, with demographic information, economic data, and statistics of traceability of the pandemic. The findings also found 15 spread models of contagion, with the SEIR model being the most widely used, followed by mathematical-based risk models. This diversity of results validates the need for these types of compilation efforts since researchers do not have a single centralized repository to collect air flight data.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3123892","Fondecyt de Iniciación 11200113 from ANID, Chile; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9591596","COVID-19;epidemiological model;contagion network;contagion simulation;air travelling","Atmospheric modeling;COVID-19;Biological system modeling;Airports;Pandemics;Coronaviruses;Mathematical models","decision making;diseases;epidemics;risk analysis;social networking (online);statistical analysis;transportation;travel industry","air travel networks;COVID-19 pandemic;health sciences;social sciences;mathematical modeling;social network analysis;decision-making process;computer simulation;COVID-19 contagion simulation;epidemiological models;SEIR model;mathematical-based risk models;air flight data","","1","","118","CCBY","27 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Using URLs as markers of information, we carry out a detailed study of retweeting, the primary mechanism by which information spreads on the Twitter follower graph. Our empirical study examines how users respond to an incoming stimulus, i.e., a tweet (message) from a friend, and reveals that dynamically decaying visibility, which is the increasing cognitive effort required for discovering and acting upon a tweet, combined with limited attention play dominant roles in retweeting behavior. Specifically, we observe that users retweet information when it is most visible, such as when it near the top of their Twitter feed. Moreover, our measurements quantify how a user's limited attention is divided among incoming tweets, providing novel evidence that highly connected individuals are less likely to propagate an arbitrary tweet. Our study indicates that the finite ability to process incoming information constrains social contagion, and we conclude that rapid decay of visibility is the primary barrier to information propagation online.","","978-1-4673-5638-1","10.1109/SocialCom-PASSAT.2012.129","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6406290","Twitter;User Interfaces;Statistical Analysis","Twitter;Sociology;Statistics;Entropy;Probability;Humans;Time factors","graph theory;information dissemination;social networking (online)","divided attention;social contagion;social media;information diffusion;online social networks;URL;Twitter follower graph;Twitter feed;information propagation","","82","","50","","10 Jan 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The aim was to examine information flow with regard to pain management in addition to explore the evolving nature of the represented network over time. For the study, social network surveys were administered to investigate characteristics of three identified nursing units. Three network questions were used to explore relationships and information flow: (a) Who do you routinely work with on pain management? (b) Who do you get new ideas or inspiration from to help your pain management efforts? (c) Who would you like to work with in the future on pain management? Two surveys were conducted to collect data over time, and standard social network measures were computed to study the interaction network and its evolving nature. Data analysis provided insights into the nature of interactions within and across these groups and thereby successfully identified key players in information flow with regard to pain management.","","978-0-7695-5089-3","10.1109/ICHI.2013.71","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6680519","","Social network services;Pain;Hospitals;Standards;Diseases;Collaboration","data analysis;diseases;health care;medical computing;social networking (online)","social network analysis;clinical teams;key player identification;pain management;social relationships;healthcare;disease contagion;smoking cessation;physical collaboration;clinicians;nursing units;data analysis;information flow","","","","3","","12 Dec 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In these models, an individual joins a protest if a sufficient number of her neighbors has already joined. This required number of neighbors is often called a “threshold.” In this study, we model a regime's ability to suppress protests by instilling fear in a subset of a population, and this fear is manifested by an increase in a person's threshold. We consider different social networks, numbers of seed nodes, and amounts of fear. Through simulations, we present several results.

In this article, we focus on the emotional contagion in physical-cyber integrated networks from the phase transition perspective. To achieve this, we first construct a physical-cyber integrated network model to describe the interactions between physical and cyber networks. Second, we build an emotional contagion model to capture the characteristics of emotional contagion in the physical and cyber integrated networks accurately. Finally, we study the phase transition phenomenon of emotional contagion and identify the critical threshold by mapping the emotional contagion to the joint site/bond percolation model.

Simulation results predict a wide variety of possible system behavior, heavily dependent on the relative trust placed on individuals of differing social connectivity. Mass-polarization toward a positive or negative consensus occurs when a synergistic mechanism between preferential trust and polarization tendencies is sustained; a division of the population into segregated groups of different polarity is also possible under certain conditions.

Probably the COVID-19 contagion is the most adverse global public health, economic, social, and technological stress since the Second World War. It affects almost all countries and challenges the globalisation particularly the global supply chain. The research community struggles with the multidimensional consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 virus infections. The critical goal is to quickly implement an efficient vaccine, as the society faces a tradeoff between death exposure and the size of the economic downturn. With this paper, we search for factors affecting contagion, mortality, and the time span between the country virus inception and first death. Additionally, we analyse the development of social media and financial markets. We applied a panel data set on all of the countries across the globe from 31 December 2019 until 31 March 2020 to investigate the patterns of epidemic development. We examined 7,642 country-daily data. We constructed classification tree regression, panel, and cross-sectional regression models. Our results support the conclusion that: 1) the speed of severity and contagion is different between themselves and across continents, 2) financial markets and social media respond differently to factors affecting contagion and severity, and 3) the time span between the first contagion in the economy and first death case cannot be plausibly explained with time-invariant variables.

In addition, the individual personality also plays an important role in crowd emotional contagion. However, few existing works have investigated the two factors jointly. To solve this problem, we propose a personalized virtual and physical cyberspace-based emotional contagion model (PVP-ECM) to simulate the process of crowd emotional contagion. First, we construct an individual emotion model and propose the personalized emotional contagion rules to consider the influences of the individual personality on crowd emotional contagion coupling the virtual and physical cyberspaces. Second, we use mean field theory to derive an evolution process and obtain mean field equations for the PVP-ECM. Then, we solve the PVP-ECM numerically using the finite difference method. Third, we construct a personalized BA scale-free network for the PVP-ECM simulation to further verify the stability of the model.

In this model, impact factors, i.e. the influence between neighborhood, and the activity of user, are taken into account together and fused into combined evidence mass function, which can be used to infer users' forwarding behavior by D-S theory reasoning.

Each contagion appears in some node and spreads through the nodes over the underlying network. In most cases, the network structure is hidden and we can only observe the times at which nodes are infected by contagions. So, inferring network structures and analyzing information diffusion processes are required in various domains. The vast majority of existing methods are parametric with the assumption that the diffusion patterns of contagions follow a particular distribution. In this paper, we propose a nonparametric method to infer the network topology, regardless of the contagion propagation model. We consider a static network and a set of given observed cascades, then, we try to infer not only the edges of the network; but also their strengths. First, we model the diffusion network as a Markov decision process (MDP), where the transition probabilities are assumed as pairwise transmission rates between the nodes. Later, a reinforcement learning paradigm is employed to solve this MDP. As compared to other methods, we do not make any assumption about the information diffusion pattern in our method; making it more general purpose. Experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets show that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art methods for different types of network structures and propagation models.","2329-924X","","10.1109/TCSS.2017.2668843","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7869356","Diffusion cascades;inferring network structure;information diffusion;Markov decision process (MDP);reinforcement learning (RL);social network","Social network services;Diffusion processes;Computational modeling;Markov processes;Blogs;Periodic structures;Optimization","graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence);Markov processes;network theory (graphs);probability;social networking (online)","social network structure;semisupervised approach;contagion diffusion pattern;nonparametric method;network topology;static network;observed cascade;diffusion network modelling;Markov decision process;MDP;transition probability;reinforcement learning","","7","","32","IEEE","2 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Indeed, various mathematical models were proposed in the literature to characterize the dynamics of such diffusion processes, and different solutions were suggested for maximizing influence under such models. However, most of these solutions focused on selecting a set of nodes to be seeded at the initial phase of the diffusion process. This paper suggests a scheduled seeding approach that aims at finding not only the best set of nodes to be seeded but also the right timing to perform these seedings. More specifically, we identify three different properties of existing contagion models that can be utilized by a scheduled approach to improve the total number of activated nodes: 1) stochastic dynamics; 2) diminishing social effect; and 3) state-dependent seeding. By analyzing each of these properties separately, we demonstrate the advantages of the scheduled seeding approach over the traditional initial seeding approach, both by theoretical and empirical evaluation. Our analysis presents an improvement of 10%-70% in the final number of infected nodes when using the scheduled seeding approach. Our findings have the potential to open up a new area of research, focusing on finding the right timing for seeding actions, thereby helping both in improving our understanding of information diffusion dynamics and in devising better strategies for influence maximization.","2329-924X","","10.1109/TCSS.2018.2852742","Kamin Grant of the Israeli Chief Scientist(grant numbers:58073); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8424548","Influence maximization;scheduling;social networks","Social network services;Mathematical model;Timing;Diseases;Dynamic scheduling;Stochastic processes;Focusing","network theory (graphs);optimisation;scheduling;set theory;social networking (online);stochastic processes","influence maximization;social networks;influential nodes;viral contagion process;diffusion process;scheduled seeding approach;activated nodes;infected nodes;seeding actions;mathematical models;stochastic dynamics;empirical evaluation;information diffusion dynamics","","17","","57","IEEE","2 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We consider hashtag and retweet adoptions on different aggregation levels: items, users, and topic groups, and study these adoption mechanisms characterized by diversified or repeated influence stimuli. We find both metrics to be heterogeneously distributed, correlated, and dependent on the topics and aggregation level of social influence.

In the recommendation model for individuals, we improve the result of collaborative filtering prediction with social contagion outcome, which simulates the result of information cascade in the decision-making process. In the recommendation model for groups, we apply social influence network theory to take interpersonal influence into account to form a settled pattern of disagreement, and then aggregate opinions of group members.

Most existing works focus on contagions where individuals' states are represented by binary variables, and propagation takes place over a single isolated network. However, characterization of an individual's standing on a given matter as a binary state might be overly simplistic as most of our opinions, feelings, and perceptions vary over more than two states. Also, most real-world contagions take place over multiple networks (e.g., Twitter and Facebook) or involve multiplex networks where individuals engage in different types of relationships (e.g., acquaintance, coworker, family, etc.). To this end, this paper studies multistage complex contagions that take place over multilayer or multiplex networks. Under a linear threshold based contagion model, we first give analytic results for the expected size of global cascades, that is, cases where a randomly chosen node can initiate a propagation that eventually reaches a positive fraction of the whole population. Next, we analytically derive the probability of triggering global cascades. Then, analytic results are confirmed and supported by an extensive numerical study. In addition, we demonstrate how the dynamics of complex contagions is affected by the extra weight exerted by hyperactive nodes and by the structural properties of the networks. In particular, we reveal an interesting connection between the assortativity of a network and the impact of hyperactive nodes on the cascade size.","2325-5870","","10.1109/TCNS.2019.2923388","National Foundation(grant numbers:CCF-1813637); Army Research Office(grant numbers:W911NF-17-1-0587); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8737745","Complex networks;computational modeling;communication networks;facebook;network topology;numerical models;sociology","Multiplexing;Facebook;Analytical models;Color;Control systems;Twitter","complex networks;network theory (graphs);probability;random processes;social network theory","hyperactive nodes;probability;multistage complex contagions;random multiplex networks;linear threshold based contagion model;single isolated network;social networks;social phenomena","","3","","33","IEEE","17 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In particular, the Dynamically Socialized User Networking (DSUN) model and sentiment-Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model, which consider a series of social factors, including user interests and social roles, semantic topics and sentiment polarities, are constructed and integrated together to facilitate the information diffusion process. A periodic-aware preception mechanism usingreinforcement learning with a newly designed reward rule based on topic distribution is then designed to detect and classify different periods into the so-called routine period and emergency period.

One hypothesis is that a fraction of those who act will also tweet about it, which implies linear scaling, action ∝ chatter. On the other hand, if there is a contagion effect (those who tweet about donation incite others to donate) and these incited donors tend to be ""quiet"" and not broadcast their actions, then we expect superlinear scaling action ∝ chatter<sup>γ</sup> where γ > 1. We show, using a simple model, that the degree sequence of the social media ""follower"" network plays a key role in determining the scaling exponent γ. For random graphs and power-law graphs, the scaling exponent is at or near 2 (quadratic amplification). We empirically validate the model's predictions using location-paired donation and social media data from U.S. states after Hurricane Sandy.

Privacy issues in such services strongly depend on the graph-theoretical properties of users' interactions representing the real friendships between users. One of the most important issues of privacy is that users may disclose information of other users beyond the scope of the interaction, without realizing that such information could be aggregated to reveal sensitive information. Determining vulnerable interactions from non-vulnerable ones is difficult due to the lack of awareness mechanisms. To address this problem, we analyze the topological relationships with the level of trust between users to notify each of them about their vulnerable social interactions. Particularly, we analyze the impact of trusting vulnerable friends in infecting other users' privacy concerns by modeling a new vulnerability contagion process. Simulation results show that over-trusting vulnerable users speeds the vulnerability diffusion process through the network. Furthermore, vulnerable users with high reputation level lead to a high convergence level of infection, this means that the vulnerability contagion process infects the biggest number of users when vulnerable users get a high level of trust from their interlocutors. This work contributes to the development of privacy awareness framework that can alert users of the potential private information leakages in their communications.","2640-558X","978-1-5386-7700-1","10.1109/MOBISECSERV.2019.8686721","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8686721","Vulnerability measurement;Messaging services;Security;Privacy","Data privacy;Social networking (online);Electronic messaging;Message service;Graph theory;Data security","data privacy;graph theory;security of data","social privacy score;vulnerability contagion process;privacy fields;privacy issues;graph-theoretical properties;sensitive information;vulnerable interactions;vulnerable social interactions;vulnerable friends;over-trusting vulnerable users;vulnerability diffusion process;privacy awareness framework","","1","","18","","11 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Two firms compete for the spread of their products in a social network. Considering their fixed budgets, they initially determine the payoff of their products and the number of their initial seeds in a network. Afterwards, neighboring agents play a local coordination game over a fixed network which determines the dynamics of the spreading. Assuming myopic best response dynamics, agents choose a product based on the payoff received by actions of their neighbors. This local update dynamics results in a game-theoretic diffusion process in the network. Utilizing earlier results in the literature, we find a lower and an upper bound on the proportion of product adoptions. We derive an explicit characterization of these bounds based on the payoff of products offered by firms, the initial number of adoptions and the underlying structure of the network. We then consider a case in which after switching to the new product, agents might later switch back to the old product with some fixed rate. We show that depending on the rate of switching back to the old product, the new product might always die out in the network eventually. Finally, we consider a game between two firms aiming to optimize their products adoptions while considering their fixed budgets. We describe the Nash equilibrium of this game and show how the optimal payoffs offered by firms and the initial number of seeds depend on the relative budgets of firms.","0743-1546","978-1-4673-2066-5","10.1109/CDC.2012.6426222","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6426222","","Games;Switches;Social network services;Equations;Nash equilibrium;Stochastic processes;Upper bound","budgeting;game theory;marketing;optimisation;social sciences","game theoretic analysis;strategic model;competitive contagion;product adoption;social network;marketing;firm;fixed budget;product payoff;neighboring agent;local coordination game;myopic best response dynamics;game-theoretic diffusion process;network structure;Nash equilibrium;optimal payoff","","22","","24","","4 Feb 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we look at how the existence of modules in the contact structure of a population affects its adoption of an innovation that is characterized by a given perceived advantage. For this we consider both theoretical models of modular networks as well as the empirical social network of a village in Karnataka. We first use a network generalization of the well-known Bass model of diffusion, which is a variant of the SI compartmental model of contagion propagation, on the empirical network and on an ensemble of degree-preserved randomized surrogates. By comparing the dynamics of the diffusion process in these networks, we see that the modular organization reduces the speed of adoption in the population. However, as there are limitations of the diffusion model, we have also considered an alternative dynamical process based on spin-spin interaction that is inspired by statistical physics. Here, individuals try to coordinate their action with that of neighbors on the contact network, while having randomly distributed thresholds (that measures their inrinsic resistance to adoption). By varying the external field, which is a measure of the perceived advantage of the innovation we observe transitions of the population to a state of complete adoption. While the model network with community organization shows that the occurrence of modularity increases the critical value of perceived advantage at which the transition happens, surprisingly we see that in the empirical network the process of adoption can occur faster than in the corresponding degree-preserved randomized surrogate. We show that by reducing the inter-modular connectivity of the empirical network, the process can indeed be made slower than the corresponding randomized networks. Our results underline the critical importance of modular organization in social networks in affecting the process of adoption of innovation in society.","2155-2509","978-1-4799-8439-8","10.1109/COMSNETS.2015.7098710","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7098710","","Mathematical model;Color;Electrostatic discharges","social networking (online)","innovation diffusion;social networks;modular organization;mesoscale feature;modular organization;community occurrence;community members;population contact structure;innovation adoption;modular networks;empirical social network;Karnataka village;network generalization;Bass diffusion model;SI compartmental model;contagion propagation;empirical network;degree-preserved randomized surrogate ensemble;diffusion process dynamics;spin-spin interaction;statistical physics;action coordination;contact network;randomly distributed thresholds;intrinsic adoption resistance;external field;perceived advantage measure;population transitions;community organization;modularity occurrence;critical value;perceived advantage;degree-preserved randomized surrogate network;intermodular connectivity;randomized networks","","1","","20","","4 May 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We propose an Agent-Based Emotion Contagion (ABEC) model that simulates the spread of group violence when the mechanism of contagious grievance is at work. The model is motivated by related social psychological theories of group behavior and is implemented by incorporating the epidemiological emotion contagion mechanism with crowd's game-theoretic behaviors with an agent-based approach. Our simulation model generates some crowd patterns, including local outbursts of collective violence with grievance contagion, dynamic spatial clustering of violent civilians and the nonlinear evolution of collective violence. We also explore the variations of violence evolution by varying some parameters of our model. Results show that the high-density crowds and the widespread of grievance promote violence outburst. These results suggest opportunities to curb collective violence through dispersing crowds and allaying the grievance.","","978-1-5386-7848-0","10.1109/ISI.2018.8587352","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8587352","collective violence;emotion contagion;agent-based model;epidemic model","Law enforcement;Safety;Psychology;Biological system modeling;Physics;Computational modeling;Mathematical model","behavioural sciences;behavioural sciences computing;evolution (biological);game theory;psychology;social sciences;software agents;statistical analysis","collective violence;agent-based emotion contagion model;collective actions;simulation model;group violence;epidemiological emotion contagion mechanism;agent-based approach;violence evolution;violence outburst","","2","","20","","27 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The characteristics of this paper are as follows. First, traders are characterized by bounded rationality and their adaptive learning behavior is represented by the genetic programming algorithm. The use of the genetic programming algorithm allows traders to freely form forecasting strategies with a great potential of variety in functional forms, which are not predetermined but may be fundamental or technical or any mix of these two broad categories, as they need to adapt to the time-varying market environment. The evolutionary nature of the genetic programming algorithm has its merit for modeling mimetic behavior in the context of information transmission in that, other than making duplicates of an entire trading rule as if a mind-reading technique exists, strategy imitation could take place down to the level of building blocks that genetic operators work out or pieces of information that constitute a strategy and are more ready to be transmitted via word-of-mouth communication, which is more intuitive compared to the existing literature. Second, the traders are spatially heterogeneous based on their positions in social networks. Mimetic learning thus takes part in local interactions among traders that are directly tied with each other when they evolve their trading strategies according to the relative performance of their own and their neighbors'. Therefore, specifically, we aim to analyze the effect of network topologies, i.e., a regular lattice, a small-world, a random network, a fully connected network, and a preferential attachment network, on market dynamics regarding price distortion, volatility, and trading volume, as information diffuses across these different social network structures.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2014.2322121","NSC(grant numbers:100-2410-H-155-026-MY2); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6826570","Agent-based modeling;artificial stock market;genetic programming;social network","Social network services;Biological system modeling;Stock markets;Genetic programming;Adaptation models;Network topology;Predictive models","genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);pricing;social networking (online);speech","social networks;asset price dynamics;behavioral contagion;mimetic strategy learning;adaptive learning behavior;genetic programming algorithm;time-varying market environment;mimetic behavior modeling;information transmission;mind-reading technique;word-of-mouth communication;market dynamics;price distortion","","13","","65","IEEE","5 Jun 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Considering the investors' trading decisions are attributed to the change of market information, new market information no matter from the macro field or the micro field can influence investor behavior and risk contagion. In our artificial stock market model, we assume new information is the sole factor affecting the fluctuation of stock prices. And investor sentiment is influenced by investor sensitivity to new information, investment decisions of neighboring investors, and investor understanding preference for new information. Through simulation experiments, some conclusions can be drawn as follows. Firstly, stock price volatility becomes stronger with increasing investor sensitivity to new information, under the condition of a smaller fundamental contagion coefficient or larger sensitivity to new information from investor neighbors. Secondly, stock price volatility becomes more moderate with increasing sensitivity to new information from investor neighbors, under the condition of a smaller fundamental contagion coefficient or smaller investor sensitivity to new information. Thirdly, with the increasing fundamental contagion coefficient, stock price volatility may strongly increase under the condition of smaller investor sensitivity to new information and smaller sensitivity to new information from investor neighbors, or slightly increase under the condition of smaller investor sensitivity to new information and larger sensitivity to new information from investor neighbors, or slightly decrease under the condition of larger investor sensitivity to new information and smaller sensitivity to new information from investor neighbors, or show a little change under the condition of larger investor sensitivity to new information and larger sensitivity to new information from investor neighbors.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3008717","Program of Humanities and Social Science Youth Foundation of the Ministry of Education of China(grant numbers:19XJC790014); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9139248","Investor behavior;risk contagion;stock price volatility;market information","Stock markets;Sensitivity;Investment;Analytical models;Gaussian distribution;Mathematical model;Stochastic processes","investment;pricing;risk analysis;stock markets","investor behavior;risk contagion;information-based artificial stock market;artificial stock market model;market information;stock prices;investor sentiment;stock price volatility;investor sensitivity;fundamental contagion coefficient;investor trading decisions;macro field;micro field;simulation experiments","","","","62","CCBY","13 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The importance of public security in modern life can be seen in the epidemic outbreak in 2020. In particular, the epidemic can affect people's psychology and emotions and change people's behavior. Therefore, how to effectively improve people's positive emotions in a panic has become an urgent problem. In social relations, most behaviors are produced by peer interaction. To simulate the interactions among peers more realistically, this paper studies the diversity and efficiency of evacuation behaviors from the trust of peers, the strength of social relations and empathy. First, a general framework of peer relationships is constructed based on asymmetric intimacy, including the relationship between intimacy relationship modeling. Then, the problem of the dynamic formation of peer groups is studied by employing the calculation method of asymmetric intimacy. The effect of positive emotion transmission mechanism on peer interaction behaviors is explored through asymmetric intimacy. Finally, the companion behaviors of the peers in several scenarios are simulated. The proposed method is compared with different emotion contagion models and the behavioral simulation models. Experimental results show that the positive emotions contagion of the peer behavior simulation method can concrete the macro group behavior and effectively simulate the peer group in an evacuation.

However, almost none of these bankruptcy models can be applied in plural environments or consider the difficulty of implementation. Furthermore, cash flow between firms, which is a highly influential factor in bankruptcy contagion situations, is considered in few such models. To address these shortcomings, in this article, a new relationship, called the cash flow relationship, is first presented based on several relationships related to cash flows. A graphical structure called a cash flow graph is then presented to record cash flow relations between financial institutions and provide a discussion of the nature of the cash flow is then presented. Next, a multi-agent bankruptcy contagion model based on the cash flow graph is introduced. Finally, inferences are drawn from the proposed model and experiments conducted to explore the bankruptcy contagion phenomenon and confirm these inferences. This proposed model can be applied in multiple environments related to cash flows to successfully address the limitations of the existing multi-agent models for bankruptcy contagion.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3024711","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:71971109,71201077,71701091); CCF-Tencent Rhino-Bird Young Faculty Open Research Fund;; Humanities and Social Science Fund of Ministry of Education of China(grant numbers:17YJC870020); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9200380","Agent decision-making;bankruptcy diffusion;structured decision-making;social network","Bankruptcy;Economics;Multi-agent systems;Analytical models;Adaptation models;Decision making","bankruptcy;data flow graphs;diseases;multi-agent systems","bankruptcy contagion situations;cash flow relationship;cash flow graph;multiagent bankruptcy contagion model;bankruptcy contagion phenomenon;structured multiagent-based model;bankruptcy models","","","","54","CCBYNCND","18 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Most existing works on selection of seeds assumed that the constant number k seeds could be selected, irrespective of the intrinsic property of each individual's different susceptibility of being influenced (e.g., it may be costly to persuade some seeds to adopt a new behavior). In this paper, a price-performance-ratio inspired heuristic scheme, PPRank, is proposed, which investigates how to economically select seeds within a given budget and meanwhile try to maximize the diffusion process. Our paper's contributions are threefold. First, we explicitly characterize each user with two distinct factors: the susceptibility of being influenced (SI) and influential power (IP) representing the ability to actively influence others and formulate users' SIs and IPs according to their social relations, and then, a convex price-demand curve-based model is utilized to properly convert each user's SI into persuasion cost (PC) representing the cost used to successfully make the individual adopt a new behavior. Furthermore, a novel cost-effective selection scheme is proposed, which adopts both the price performance ratio (PC-IP ratio) and user's IP as an integrated selection criterion and meanwhile explicitly takes into account the overlapping effect; finally, simulations using both artificially generated and real-trace network data illustrate that, under the same budgets, PPRank can achieve larger diffusion range than other heuristic and brute-force greedy schemes without taking users' persuasion costs into account.","1937-9234","","10.1109/JSYST.2014.2369526","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61171092); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7018025","Influence maximization;price-performance ratio (PC-IP ratio);social networks","Social network services;IP networks;Greedy algorithms;Heuristic algorithms;Economics","greedy algorithms;optimisation;pricing;social networking (online)","price performance ratio;PC-IP ratio;integrated selection criterion;real-trace network data;PPRank;heuristic force greedy schemes;brute-force greedy schemes;social networks;influence maximization problem;so-called seeds;adoptions;contagion process;constant number;intrinsic property;price-performance-ratio inspired heuristic scheme;diffusion process;influential power;social relations;convex price-demand curve-based model;persuasion cost;susceptibility;cost-effective selection scheme","","20","","32","IEEE","22 Jan 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We empirically evaluated the effects of near visually realistic vs. non-realistic stylized appearance of virtual humans on the emotional response of participants in a medical virtual reality system that was designed to educate users in recognizing the signs and symptoms of patient deterioration. In a between-subjects experiment protocol, participants interacted with one of three different appearances of a virtual patient, namely visually realistic, cartoon-shaded and charcoal-sketch like conditions in a mixed reality simulation. Emotional impact were measured via a combination of quantitative objective measures were gathered using skin Electrodermal Activity (EDA) sensors, and quantitative subjective measures such as the Differential Emotion Survey (DES IV), Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), and Social Presence questionnaire. The emotional states of the participants were analyzed across four distinct time steps during which the medical condition of the virtual patient deteriorated (an emotionally stressful interaction), and were contrasted to a baseline affective state. Objective EDA results showed that in all three conditions, male participants exhibited greater levels of arousal as compared to female participants. We found that negative affect levels were significantly lower in the visually realistic condition, as compared to the stylized appearance conditions. Furthermore, in emotional dimensions of interest-excitement, surprise, anger, fear and guilt participants in all conditions responded similarly. However, in social emotional constructs of shyness, presence, perceived personality, and enjoyment-joy, we found that participants responded differently in the visually realistic condition as compared to the cartoon and sketch conditions. Our study suggests that virtual human appearance can affect not only critical emotional reactions in affective inter-oersonal trainina scenarios. but also users' oerceotions of oersonalitv and social characteristic of the virtual interlocutors.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2016.2518158","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7383334","Virtual/Digital Characters;Visual Fidelity;Emotion Contagion;Virtual/Digital Characters;Visual Fidelity;Emotion Contagion;Psychology;User Studies","Rendering (computer graphics);Visualization;Electronic mail;Solid modeling;Training;Animation;Atmospheric measurements","computer animation;emotion recognition;human factors;medical computing;psychology;virtual reality","virtual human appearance fidelity;emotion contagion;affective interpersonal simulations;simulated interpersonal situations;emotional responses;nonrealistic stylized appearance;medical virtual reality system;patient deterioration symptoms;cartoon-shaded conditions;charcoal-sketch like conditions;mixed reality simulation;skin electrodermal activity sensors;skin EDA sensors;differential emotion survey;positive and negative affect schedule;PANAS;social presence questionnaire;female participants;visually realistic condition;emotional dimensions;shyness;enjoyment-joy;interpersonal training scenarios","Computer Graphics;Emotions;Ergonomics;Facial Expression;Female;Humans;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Interpersonal Relations;Male;User-Computer Interface","60","","40","OAPA","14 Jan 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Previous studies usually simplify the social relationships as binary, though in real social networks, the different intimacy between nodes in different layers will affect the information spreading. The enhancement of non-redundant information memory also plays an important role in information spreading. In this paper, we propose a weighted two-layered social network information spreading model based on threshold model. In order to qualitatively understand the impact of weight distribution heterogeneity on information spreading, an edge-weight based compartmental theory is proposed. We find that under an arbitrary adoption threshold, reducing weight distribution heterogeneity can facilitate information spreading and promote the global adoption, yet unable to change the dependence pattern of the final adoption size on the unit transmission probability. We also find that when the initial seed fraction is less than a critical value, information cannot be transmitted explosively in the network. Increasing the fraction of initial seeds or the heterogeneity of degree distribution will alter the dependence pattern of the final adoption size on the unit transmission probability from being discontinuous to being continuous.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2948941","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61602048,61773148); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2019T120829); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2018M631073); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8879594","Complex networks;information spreading;weighted network;non-redundant information;edge-weight compartmental theory","Analytical models;Social networking (online);Numerical models;Numerical simulation;Licenses;Information processing;Cavity resonators","complex networks;network theory (graphs);probability;social networking (online);social sciences computing","social relationships;information spreading;nonredundant information memory;social network information;weight distribution heterogeneity;edge-weight based compartmental theory;two-layered weighted complex network","","4","","33","CCBY","22 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we study the group emotion evolution process with the agent based simulation method. Along the way, the events-chain model is proposed to modeling the over-lapping influence of the temporal successive events. The simulation experiments of correlation events and events-chain model of a real public incident are performed based on the constructed framework. The results show that the group emotion evolution processes of correlation events have different patterns with the single event, and they cannot analyze as two independent events.

Defined as the effort to block the spread of support for an insurgency, such operations lack the manpower to defend the entire population and must focus on the opinions of a subset of local leaders. As past researchers of security resource allocation have done, we propose using game theory to develop such policies and model the interconnected network of leaders as a graph. Unlike this past work in security games, actions in these domains possess a probabilistic, non-local impact. To address this new class of security games, we combine recent research in influence-blocking maximization with a double oracle approach and create novel heuristic oracles to generate mixed strategies for a real-world leadership network from Afghanistan, synthetic leadership networks and scale-free graphs. We find that leadership networks that exhibit highly interconnected clusters can be solved equally well by our heuristic methods, but our more sophisticated heuristics outperform simpler ones in less interconnected scale-free graphs.","1460-2067","","10.1093/comjnl/bxt094","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8130864","game theory;social networks;contagion","","","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Hence a cost effective and highly efficient solution is required which provide an alert when any two or more users come in close vicinity of each other which is lower than the permissible safe distance limit. This paper presents how ST BlueNRG-2 based device enables social distancing solution; the device generates an alert if the two or more devices are at lesser distance than safe distance limit (for example 2 meters or less). Two devices are advertising and scanning together to check if any other beacon is detected. Mathematical filters are applied to reduce the variation of RSSI observed, even when the devices are at fixed distance. The advertised data can be randomized to keep the communication secure and avoid spoofing. State machine for different modes were implemented which includes different Low Power Modes state for longer battery life and high probability detection mode.","","978-1-7281-9180-5","10.1109/ICCCS49678.2020.9277175","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9277175","Social Distancing;Bluetooth® Low Energy;Beacons;BLE;iBeacon;BlueNRG-2","Advertising;Social factors;Human factors;Accelerometers;Bluetooth;Optimization;Batteries","Bluetooth;diseases;epidemics;RSSI;telecommunication security","Bluetooth Low energy;symptomatic people;COVID19;permissible safe distance limit;ST BlueNRG-2 based device;smart social distancing solution;mathematical filters;RSSI;spoofing","","3","","9","","9 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Following the increased popularity of the internet, more and more people are using online social networks, and recent research has found that online users have real-world emotional contagion behaviors. However, most previous studies were based mainly on text analysis and few have analyzed single emotions. Therefore, in this paper, we take Facebook as the study object, and we analyze the influences of interactive behaviors, such as the number of `likes' a post receives, the number of times a post is shared, the number of followers, and the number of comments on a post, on the user's state of happiness. We thus establish which kinds of online users possess the most influencing state of happiness. The experimental results show that the number of times a post is shared is the best indicator of online users possessing the most influencing state of happiness.","","978-1-5386-9273-8","10.1109/ICOMIS.2018.8644954","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8644954","emotional contagion;text mining;facebook;reactions;social networking site","Fans;Facebook;Correlation coefficient;Correlation;Mathematical model;Information management","Internet;social networking (online);text analysis","happiness influences;online social networks;life behaviors;interpersonal interactions;online users;real-world emotional contagion behaviors;interactive behaviors;emotions","","","","19","","21 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By simulating various situations with different risk origins and scales, the speed of risk contagion and the total impacts on the overall stability of the market (network) are compared. We find that the herd behavior of the market will generally aggravate the consequences of risk contagion. Compared with unicorns, the failure of a leading VC firm can cause a wider range of risk contagion. The contagion consequences caused by the failure of random financing companies are more serious than those caused by random VC firms.

Governments have not yet decided on an optimal plan to defend from COVID-19 due to lack of previous experience with such large-scale pandemics. Neither have researchers published a holistic approach of anticontagion policy analysis. In order to explore the middle ground of minimized negative effects on health and economy, this paper evaluated 1,637 non-pharmaceutical anti-contagion policies from sub-regions in China, France, Italy, and South Korea. Inspired by previous research [1] [2], we utilized reduced-form approach and Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model in the field of macroeconomics to calculate the effect of each individual policy on infection and GDP growth rates. These methods are based on filtered financial accounts (i.e. social accounting matrices) obtained from Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) database along with a published G-Cubed (G20) model, as well as the epidemiological data concerning the national conditions of each aforementioned country. We complete more than 1,000 random samplings and iterations to average the policy coefficients of infection and GDP growth rates and minimize their standard errors. The major observation on the results is that an early implementation of travel ban for 2 weeks will effectively undermine the spread of COVID-19 at a low economic price. In addition, some policies (e.g. social distancing) require adjustment in their duration or range to improve their price-performance ratio (here, economic-health ratio). This form of hybrid policy analysis not only prevents further infectivity, but also ensures the stability of the global economy.","","978-1-6654-0428-0","10.1109/CDS52072.2021.00093","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9463251","COVid-19;Anti-Contagion Policy;Reduced-form Approach;Computable General Equilibrium (CGE)","COVID-19;Economic indicators;Pandemics;Computational modeling;Human factors;Social factors;Stability analysis","diseases;economic indicators;epidemics;government policies;health care;macroeconomics;random processes;sampling methods;socio-economic effects","South Korea;CGE model;macroeconomics;epidemiological data;social distancing;price-performance ratio;economic-health ratio;global economy stability;infectivity prevention;Italy;France;China;large-scale pandemics;novel coronavirus;COVID-19 regional propagation;GDP growth rates;nonpharmaceutical anticontagion policies;GTAP database;economic coefficients;epidemiological coefficients;hybrid policy analysis;COVID-19 spread;policy coefficients;random samplings;G-Cubed model;Global Trade Analysis Project database;social accounting matrices;filtered financial accounts;infection;computable general equilibrium model;reduced-form approach;anticontagion policy analysis;global public health emergency","","","","17","","5 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We showed that collective behavior is affected by clustering coefficient. In regular network and small world network for a homogeneous preferences population, minority choice has a chance to spread throughout in the population. This is when the standardized clustering coefficient is low. We showed that collective behavior is affected by standard deviation. In population of uniform distribution and two-sided distribution, minority choice has a chance to spread throughout in the population. This is when standardized deviation is high.

Various propagation models have been proposed to describe the way cascades unfold in OSNs. Based on the existing propagation models, several studies address the problem of influence maximization, where the objective is to identify an appropriate subset of users to initiate the spread of a contagion. However, existing approaches ignore an important factor in the propagation process, i.e., the correlation of multiple contagions simultaneously cascading in the social network and how these affect the users' decisions regarding the adoption of a contagion. Although recent works look into either the competition or the complementarity among a pair of contagions, a uniform model that describes the propagation of multiple cascades with varying types and degrees of correlations is lacking. This work constitutes the first attempt to fill this gap. We formulate a novel propagation model, the Correlated Contagions Dynamic Linear Threshold (CCDLT), that considers the correlation of many contagions in either competitive or complementary manner. Our proposed model allows for different degrees of competition/complementarity among cascades. We further consider that users may dynamically switch states regarding the contagion they promote during the propagation process, based on the influence of their neighborhoods. We then design a greedy seed selection algorithm that identifies the appropriate subset of users to participate in a specific contagion in order to maximize its spread and we formally prove that it approximates the best solution at a ratio of 1 - 1/e. Through an extensive experimental evaluation we demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing schemes.","1063-6927","978-1-5386-1792-2","10.1109/ICDCS.2017.163","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7980033","social networks;influence maximization;correlated contagions","Correlation;Twitter;Tagging;Biological system modeling;Diffusion processes;Informatics","greedy algorithms;marketing data processing;optimisation;social networking (online)","influence maximization;online social networks;OSN;greedy seed selection algorithm;correlated contagions dynamic linear threshold;word-of-mouth effect;viral marketing campaigns","","8","","33","","17 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Most existing works focus on contagions where individuals' states are represented by <i>binary</i> variables, and propagation takes place over a single isolated network. However, characterization of an individual's standing on a given matter as a binary state might be overly simplistic as most of our opinions, feelings, and perceptions vary over more than two states. Also, most real-world contagions take place over multiple networks (e.g., Twitter and Facebook) or involve <i>multiplex</i> networks where individuals engage in different types of relationships (e.g., co-worker, family, etc.). To this end, this paper studies <i>multi-stage</i> complex contagions that take place over multi-layer or multiplex networks. Under a linear threshold based contagion model, we first give analytic results for the expected size of <i>global</i> cascades, i.e., cases where a randomly chosen node can initiate a propagation that eventually reaches a <i>positive</i> fraction of the whole population. Then, analytic results are confirmed by an extensive numerical study. In addition, we demonstrate how the dynamics of complex contagions is affected by the structural properties of the networks. In particular, we reveal an interesting connection between the assortativity of a network and the impact of <i>hyper-active</i> nodes on the cascade size.","2576-6813","978-1-7281-0962-6","10.1109/GLOBECOM38437.2019.9013531","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9013531","","Multiplexing;Numerical models;Facebook;Color;Computational modeling;Twitter","complex networks;network theory (graphs);social networking (online)","multiplex network;linear threshold based contagion model;multilayer network;multistage complex contagions;single isolated network;social networks;social phenomena;complex contagion models;random multiplex networks;influence propagation","","","","15","","27 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Existing literature mainly focus on investigating how network structure affects the contagion of health sentiments. However, most of these studies neglect that the interaction topology change in time. In fact, the change of inter-individual connections over time is associated with individual attributes. The mechanism through which individual attributes reshapes the connection topology is mainly governed by the competition between two principles, i.e., homophily (establishing or reinforcing social connections) and homeostasis (preserving the total strength of social connections to each individual). No existing approaches are yet able to accommodate these two competing effects at the same time. We thus propose a new statistical model (H2 model, Homophily and Homestasis model) to depict the evolution of temporal network, which is governed by the competition of homophily and homeostasis. In addition, we consider the mediation effect of external shock events, which enables us to separate exogenous confounding factors. Evaluation on Twitter data suggests that H2 model can capture long-range sentiment dynamics and external shock events. In sentiment prediction, H2 consistently outperforms existing methods in terms of error rate. Through the model's shock tensor, we successfully detect several typical events, and reveal that users in negative emotions are more influenced by external shock events than those with positive emotions. Our findings have practical significance for those who supervise and guide health sentiments in online communities.","","978-1-5090-6727-5","10.1109/ISI.2017.8004882","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8004882","health sentiment;competitive interactions;homophily;homeostasis;social media","Electric shock;Social network services;Topology;Network topology;Tensile stress;Diffusion processes;Mathematical model","health care;medical computing;social networking (online)","health sentiment dynamics;competitive interactions;social media;public sentiments;network structure;health sentiments;interaction topology;connection topology;reinforcing social connections;statistical model;homestasis model;homophily model;temporal network;confounding factors;Twitter data;external shock events;long-range sentiment dynamics;online communities","","","","24","","10 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work, we present three optimization strategies to guide human mobility and restrict contact of susceptible and infective individuals. The proposed strategies rely on well-studied concepts of network science, such as clustering and homophily, as well as two different scenarios of the SEIRD epidemic model. We also propose a new metric, called contagion potential, to gauge the infectivity of individuals in a social setting.

However, ""social signals"" such as product purchase time, or blog entry timestamps are measurable, and implicitly depend on the underlying topology, making it possible to track it over time. Interestingly, network topologies often ""jump"" between discrete states that may account for sudden changes in the observed signals. The present paper advocates a switched dynamic structural equation model to capture the topology-dependent cascade evolution, as well as the discrete states driving the underlying topologies. Leveraging the edge sparsity inherent to social networks, a recursive ℓ<sub>1</sub>-norm regularized least-squares estimator is put forth to jointly track the states and network topologies.

Can we identify the source node(s) that are responsible to initiate the propagation originally? If so, when did they initiated the propagation? The problem of identifying the source of propagation based on limited observations has been studied significantly in recent years, as it can help to reduce the damage caused by unwanted infections with early detection. In this paper, we present an efficient algorithm for finding a node initiating a piece of information into the network and also inferring the time when it is initiated. We propose Source Location Estimation method, SoLE, that estimate the source probability for each node and then choose the source set which are maximize the probability using a well-known greedy method with a theoretical guarantees. The Observed nodes are detected nodes which are known clearly that spread specified malicious information in the network but small fraction of nodes are detected. The Hidden infected nodes are hidden, which spread the information in the network, however, they're not identified yet. In this problem, we first estimate the shortest path between other nodes to observed ones for each propagation trace, SoLE. Afterward, we find the best nodes as the source set among the hidden nodes by optimizing a loss function. Our experiments on real-world propagation through networks show the superiority of our approach in detecting true sources and promote the top ten accuracy from less than 10% for the state-of-the-art methods to approximately 30%.","","978-1-6654-0441-9","10.1109/IKT51791.2020.9345640","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9345640","Source Localization;Information Propagation;Diffusion Networks;Information Cascades","Knowledge engineering;Social networking (online);Focusing;Estimation;Position measurement;Approximation algorithms","graph theory;greedy algorithms;invasive software;network theory (graphs);probability;social networking (online);telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","spread specified malicious information;observed ones;propagation trace;SoLE;source set;hidden nodes;real-world propagation;revert propagation;contagion initialization;diffusion network;social network;source node;unwanted infections;Source Location Estimation method;source probability;greedy method;theoretical guarantees;Observed nodes","","","","22","","10 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

NSSI is particularly prevalent among adolescents and young adults as a means of emotional regulation. With the proliferation of social media, NSSI content is frequently being posted, viewed, and shared on popular social media platforms, which may increase social contagion among adolescents. To address this problem, this work first quantifies the prevalence of NSSI content on social media. We develop a content crawler that searches for posts, images, and videos with NSSI-related hashtags (e.g., #selfharm), downloads NSSI content from target social media platforms, and stores them in cloud storage. We then perform a trend analysis, which confirms a steep increase in NSSI posts on social media. Moreover, this work develops an image classifier to identify NSSI or non-NSSI images from social media content. Our classifier is based on the idea of weakly supervised object localization. We evaluate our NSSI classifier with more than 30K labeled NSSI images collected from social media. In our evaluation, our classifier accurately identifies NSSI images with 94% accuracy, and it outperforms state-of-the-art pre-trained models. An accurate NSSI image classifier is an essential first step to enable us and/or social media providers to protect adolescents and young adults from social contagion due to NSSI exposure through such actions as legitimate filtering mechanisms.","","978-1-7281-6737-4","10.1109/CogMI48466.2019.00017","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8998990","Non-Suicidal Self-Injury;Social Media Content Analysis;Image Classification;Deep Learning","Videos;Twitter;Tagging;Task analysis;Training;Crawlers","behavioural sciences computing;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);social networking (online)","adolescents;young adults;NSSI content;social contagion;content crawler;NSSI-related hashtags;social media platforms;NSSI posts;social media content;social media providers;NSSI exposure;NSSI image classifier;nonsuicidal self-injury;legitimate filtering mechanisms","","1","","45","","17 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Social media, like Twitter, has been increasingly used for exchanging information, opinions and emotions about events that are happening across the world. Here we propose a novel visualization design, “Whisper”, for tracing the process of information diffusion in social media in real time. Our design highlights three major characteristics of diffusion processes in social media: the temporal trend, social-spatial extent, and community response of a topic of interest. Such social, spatiotemporal processes are conveyed based on a sunflower metaphor whose seeds are often dispersed far away. In Whisper, we summarize the collective responses of communities on a given topic based on how tweets were retweeted by groups of users, through representing the sentiments extracted from the tweets, and tracing the pathways of retweets on a spatial hierarchical layout. We use an efficient flux line-drawing algorithm to trace multiple pathways so the temporal and spatial patterns can be identified even for a bursty event. A focused diffusion series highlights key roles such as opinion leaders in the diffusion process. We demonstrate how our design facilitates the understanding of when and where a piece of information is dispersed and what are the social responses of the crowd, for large-scale events including political campaigns and natural disasters.

On the other hand, the connections among vertices in many real world contagions are usually not solely binary entities (either present or not) but have associated magnitudes and directions. We formulate the flow-aware vertex protection (FAVP) problem to elaborate more efficient and realistic way to prevent infection spreading in graphs by protecting a set of vertices. We also demonstrate that the FAVP problem is NP-Hard.

This paper addresses primitive emotional contagion during dyadic interactions in which roles are prefixed. Primitive emotional contagion was defined as the tendency people have to automatically mimic and synchronize their multimodal behavior during interactions and, consequently, to emotionally converge. To capture emotional contagion, a cross-recurrence based methodology that explicitly integrates short and long-term temporal dynamics through the analysis of both facial expressions and sentiment was developed. This approach is employed to assess emotional contagion at unimodal, multimodal and cross-modal levels and is evaluated on the Solid SAL-SEMAINE corpus.

It determines both those technologies that receive wide support from the community and those which may be abandoned, thus rendering developers’ investments worthless. Aim and Context: We model software technology adoption by developers and provide insights on specific technology attributes that are associated with better visibility among alternative technologies. Thus, our findings have practical value for developers seeking to increase the adoption rate of their products. Approach: We leverage social contagion theory and statistical modeling to identify, define, and test empirically measures that are likely to affect software adoption. More specifically, we leverage a large collection of open source version control repositories (containing over 4 billion unique versions) to construct a software dependency chain for a specific set of R language source-code files. We formulate logistic regression models, where developers’ software library choices are modeled, to investigate the combination of technological attributes that drive adoption among competing data frame (a core concept for a data science languages) implementations in the R language: <monospace>tidy</monospace> and <monospace>data.table</monospace>. To describe each technology, we quantify key project attributes that might affect adoption (e.g., response times to raised issues, overall deployments, number of open defects, knowledge base) and also characteristics of developers making the selection (performance needs, scale, and their social network). Results: We find that a quick response to raised issues, a larger number of overall deployments, and a larger number of high-score StackExchange questions are associated with higher adoption. Decision makers tend to adopt the technology that is closer to them in the technical dependency network and in author collaborations networks while meeting their performance needs. To gauge the generalizability of the proposed methodology, we investigate the spread of two popular web JavaScript frameworks <monospace>Angular</monospace> and <monospace>React</monospace>, and discuss the results. Future work: We hope that our methodology encompassing social contagion that captures both rational and irrational preferences and the elucidation of key measures from large collections of version control data provides a general path toward increasing visibility, driving better informed decisions, and producing more sustainable and widely adopted software.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2020.2993758","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:IIS-1633437); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9091014","Choice models;social contagion;technology adoption;library migration;software supply chain","Software;Supply chains;Technological innovation;Software measurement;Data models;Time factors;Libraries","configuration management;human factors;Java;public domain software;regression analysis;social networking (online);software libraries","software technologies;particular software technology;model software technology adoption;specific technology attributes;adoption rate;leverage social contagion theory;software adoption;open source version control repositories;software dependency chain;R language source-code files;logistic regression models;technological attributes;data science languages;raised issues;knowledge base;version control data;sustainable adopted software","","2","","60","IEEE","11 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We propose a stochastic framework which assumes that item adoptions are governed by un underlying diffusion process over the unobserved social network, and that such diffusion model is based on community-level influence. By fitting the model parameters to the user activity log, we learn the community membership and the level of influence of each user in each community. This allows to identify for each community the ""key"" users, i.e., the leaders which are most likely to influence the rest of the community to adopt a certain item. The general framework can be instantiated with different diffusion models.

This enables simulation of the multi-agent system at a more abstract level by considering groups as single entities substituting a large number of interacting agents.

As difficult as it may be to accelerate an individual's learning rate, it is even more complicated to accelerate the learning rate of a group. Knowledge management has devoted a great amount of study and research into learning efficiency. In theory, managing knowledge behaviors greatly affects knowledge management. However in practice, knowledge is difficult to manage directly. The structure of a working team represents a miniature social system as well as an internal collaboration network. Differing teamwork structures conduct different knowledge behaviors. Social influence theories suggest that different social proximities evoke distinguishing contagion effects. This study applies a social network perspective to explore the knowledge behaviors of computer software developers. Our findings show that controlling network redundancies can effectively enhance knowledge diffusion efficiency. Furthermore, if a team fails to manage knowledge diffusion, it will potentially offset any competitive advantages that might be gained via upgrading technology.

We analyzed the quantitative and qualitative measures associated with participants' emotional state at four distinct time-steps in the simulated interpersonal experience as the virtual patient's medical condition deteriorated. Results suggest that participants in the dynamic condition with animations exhibited a higher sense of co-presence and greater emotional response as compared to participants in the static condition, corresponding to the deterioration in the medical condition of the virtual patient. Negative affect of participants in the dynamic condition increased at a higher rate than for participants in the static condition.

We use a popular agent-based social force model to simulate a pedestrian crowd as it passes near a stationary robot. The modelling framework permits analysis of difficult-to-test situations such as high density crowds and the effects of contagion whereby more people are likely to interact with the robot if it is already surrounded by an audience. Accordingly, we augment the modelling framework to account for varying crowd densities, human-robot interaction, and social influence, and inform the parameter values from empirical studies in literature. Our results show that while the rate-of-interaction, defined as the number of agents located within an interacting distance per minute, increases with flow density, the average interaction-time is independent of the same. We find that inducing social influence through contagion does not have a significant effect on the rate at which agents engage with the robot in dense crowd scenarios, and has a marginal effect at low densities. The interaction-time was found to depend on the interaction-speed at which agents engage with the robot. These results indicate that at normally witnessed flow densities crowding near the robot is unlikely to take place, and the effect of robot design choices supersede the effects of social force or contagion.","","978-1-4799-9994-1","10.1109/IROS.2015.7353704","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7353704","","Force;Robot sensing systems;Adaptation models;Human-robot interaction;Context modeling;Visualization","human-robot interaction;pedestrians","social robot;moving pedestrian crowd;human-robot interaction scenario;agent-based social force model;contagion effect;crowd density;social influence;robot design choice","","1","","28","","17 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the so-termed adoption times when blogs mention popular news items, individuals in a community catch an infectious disease, or consumers adopt a trendy electronics product are typically known, and are implicitly dependent on the underlying network. To infer the network topology, a dynamic structural equation model is adopted to capture the relationship between observed adoption times and the unknown edge weights. Assuming a slowly time-varying topology and leveraging the sparse connectivity inherent to social networks, edge weights are estimated by minimizing a sparsity-regularized exponentially-weighted least-squares criterion. To this end, solvers with complementary strengths are developed by leveraging (pseudo) real-time sparsity-promoting proximal gradient iterations, the improved convergence rate of accelerated variants, or reduced computational complexity of stochastic gradient descent. Numerical tests with both synthetic and real data demonstrate the effectiveness of the novel algorithms in unveiling sparse dynamically-evolving topologies, while accounting for external influences in the adoption times. Key events in the political leadership in North Korea and the initial public offering of LinkedIn explain connectivity changes observed in the associated networks inferred from global cascades of online media.","1941-0484","","10.1109/JSTSP.2014.2317284","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6797935","Structural equation model;dynamic network;social network;contagion;sparsity","Network topology;Heuristic algorithms;Signal processing algorithms;Topology;Mathematical model;Convergence;Integrated circuits","complex networks;computational complexity;convergence of numerical methods;gradient methods;least mean squares methods;minimisation;network theory (graphs);social networking (online);statistical analysis;stochastic processes;telecommunication network topology;time-varying networks","proximal gradient algorithm;cascade tracking;social networks;complex network;blogs;infectious disease;electronics product;dynamic structural equation model;observed adoption times;edge weight estimation;time-varying network topology;sparse connectivity;regularized exponentially weighted least square criterion;minimization;improved convergence rate;accelerated variants;reduced computational complexity;stochastic gradient descent;sparse dynamically evolving topology;political leadership;LinkedIn;online media;global cascade","","63","","40","IEEE","14 Apr 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Then, we examine the potential of a scheduled seeding strategy by analyzing a real-world large-scale dataset containing both the network topology as well as the nodes’ infection times. Specifically, we use the proposed methods to demonstrate the existence of two important effects in our dataset: a complex contagion effect and a diminishing social influence effect. As shown in a recent study, the scheduled seeding approach is expected to benefit greatly from the existence of these two effects. Finally, we compare a number of benchmark seeding strategies to a scheduled seeding strategy that ranks nodes based on a combination of the number of infectious friends (NIF) they have, as well as the time that has passed since they became infectious. Results of our analyses show that for a seeding budget of 1%, the scheduled seeding strategy yields a convergence rate that is 14% better than a seeding strategy based solely on their degrees, and 215% better than a random seeding strategy, which is often used in practice.","2329-924X","","10.1109/TCSS.2021.3109043","Kamin Grant of the Israeli Chief Scientist(grant numbers:58073); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9534701","Influence maximization;scheduled seeding;social network analysis","Social networking (online);Mathematical model;Statistics;Sociology;Analytical models;Approximation algorithms;Greedy algorithms","graph theory;network theory (graphs);optimisation;probability;social networking (online)","real-world setting;given seeding strategy;scheduled seeding strategy;nodes;diminishing social influence effect;scheduled seeding approach;benchmark seeding strategies;seeding budget;random seeding strategy;influence maximization","","1","","49","IEEE","9 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With the fact that emotions may lead to wider information propagation, we propose an emotion-based independent cascade model to describe the process of information spread in the circumstance of emotion contagion in online social media. In our model, a message is depicted as a distribution of five emotions and each emotion has a propagation probability between different users. Thus the propagation probability of a message is the weighted average of different emotions. In addition, we introduce an improved method to estimate the parameters of the proposed model. Experimental results on a realistic Weibo data set demonstrate that our model is much better in predicting the real-world information propagation than existing baselines.

Typically it is assumed that after recovery from an infection, every agent will either return to its original susceptible state or acquire full immunity to reinfection. We study the network SIRI (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Infected) model, an epidemic model for the spread of contagious processes on a network of heterogeneous agents that can adapt their susceptibility to reinfection. The model generalizes existing models to accommodate realistic conditions in which agents acquire partial or compromised immunity after first exposure to an infection. We prove necessary and sufficient conditions on model parameters and network structure that distinguish four dynamic regimes: infection-free, epidemic, endemic, and bistable. For the bistable regime, which is not accounted for in traditional models, we show how there can be a rapid resurgent epidemic after what looks like convergence to an infection-free population. We use the model and its predictive capability to show how control strategies can be designed to mitigate problematic contagious behaviors.","1558-2523","","10.1109/TAC.2020.2985300","Army Research Office(grant numbers:W911NF-18-1-0325); Office of Naval Research(grant numbers:N00014-19-1-2556); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9057446","Adaptive systems, complex networks;multiagent systems;propagation of infection;spreading dynamics","Adaptation models;Sociology;Statistics;Steady-state;Analytical models;Adaptive systems;Computational modeling","artificial immune systems;convergence;directed graphs;epidemics;multi-agent systems;network theory (graphs);stability","adaptive susceptibility;contagion models;contagious processes;infectious diseases;social behaviors;computer viruses;biological systems;social systems;technological systems;epidemic model;finite populations;steady-state behavior;susceptible state;heterogeneous agents;partial immunity;compromised immunity;network structure;infection-free population;problematic contagious behaviors;stability analysis;strongly connected digraphs;rapid resurgent epidemic;sufficient conditions;necessary conditions;transient behavior;reinfection susceptibility;network SIRI model;susceptible-infected-recovered-infected model","","4","","49","IEEE","6 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

After data preparation, we analyze the validation of three different assumptions. First, we study the effects of follower-followee relations in the spread of the campaign hashtags. Based on the timestamps of the posts, we invoke NetRate method to estimate information diffusion rates over edges of follower-followee network. Then, by application of Louvain method as a community detection algorithm, we investigate the relation of community membership and contagion transmission rate. Finally, we study observed topical preferences in network communities. Results show the flow of information from followees to followers with a significant rate of diffusion over the whole network. However, being part of a specific community does not contribute to be exposed to a cascade faster than others. While the communities were defined based on modularity maximization and no information related to hashtags involved, a topical preference also is observed within the communities' hashtags which had the same orientation as observed in two major political parties of Iran.","","978-1-5386-0420-5","10.1109/ICWR.2017.7959297","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7959297","networks of information diffusion;information cascades;memes;community detection;structural features;social networks","Twitter;Tagging;Voting;Filtration;Delays;Computer science","government data processing;social networking (online)","Iranian Instagram users;parliament election campaign;followee network;social media;social network analysis;hashtag diffusion;legislative election;follower-followee relations;campaign hashtags;NetRate method;information diffusion rates;Louvain method;community detection algorithm;community membership;contagion transmission rate;topical preferences;modularity maximization","","4","","21","","29 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Straightforward simulations of such process do not scale well, limiting the use of individual-based models to very small populations. EpiSimdemics is specifically designed to scale to social networks with 100 million individuals. The scaling is obtained by exploiting the semantics of disease evolution and disease propagation in large networks. We evaluate an MPI-based parallel implementation of EpiSimdemics on a mid-sized HPC system, demonstrating that EpiSimdemics scales well.

Immunization is an important problem in multiple different domains like epidemiology, public health, cyber security, and social media. Additionally, clearly immunization at group scale (like schools and communities) is more realistic due to constraints in implementations and compliance (e.g., it is hard to ensure specific individuals take the adequate vaccine). Hence, efficient algorithms for such a “group-based” problem can help public-health experts take more practical decisions. However, most prior work has looked into individual-scale immunization. In this paper, we study the problem of controlling propagation at group scale. We formulate a set of novel Group Immunization problems for multiple natural settings (for both threshold and cascade-based contagion models under both node-level and edge-level interventions) and develop multiple efficient algorithms, including provably approximate solutions.

Multiple prior works have considered empirical studies and introduced new diffusion models to understand the dynamics of the diffusion process. However, the complexity of network structures and user interactions make it challenging to model the diffusion mechanisms of online social networks and to accurately predict diffusion. In this paper, we propose an information diffusion prediction model based on a physical radiation energy transfer mechanism. The aim of this model is to predict the diffusion graph of a certain contagion throughout an interest-based community. This non-parametric model can accommodate the dynamicity of online social networks because it can receive different input diffusion parameters at different diffusion contagions. With our RADiation DIFFusion (RADDIFF) model, we precisely capture the information diffusion process from both temporal and spatial dimensions and measure the level of influence initiated by certain influencers for each diffusion process. To our knowledge, this model is the first in this domain that exploits the prediction of information networks based on a physical radiation mechanism. We conduct an extensive analysis using an experiment that includes two well-known prediction diffusion models, the linear influence model (LIM) and NETINF. The results show that RADDIFF effectively outperforms both the LIM and NETINF in terms of accuracy and the quality of forecast.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2764001","Deanship of Scientific Research and Research Center of College of Computer and Information Sciences, King Saud University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8070117","Radiation;information diffusion;online social networks;RADDIFF","Mathematical model;Social network services;Predictive models;Analytical models;Integrated circuit modeling;Heating systems;Diffusion processes","diffusion;graph theory;information networks;radiative transfer;social networking (online)","information diffusion process;information networks;physical radiation mechanism;prediction diffusion models;information diffusion predictive model;online social networks;information exchange;diffusion mechanisms;information diffusion prediction model;physical radiation energy transfer mechanism;diffusion graph;nonparametric model;radiation diffusion model;linear influence model;LIM;NETINF","","11","","63","CCBY","17 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Hence, detecting compromised accounts is a necessary step toward a safe and secure social media environment. Nevertheless, detecting compromised accounts faces several challenges. First, social media activities of users are temporally correlated which plays an important role in compromised account detection. Second, data associated with social media accounts is inherently sparse. Finally, social contagions where multiple accounts become compromised, take advantage of the user connectivity to propagate their attack. Thus how to represent each user's network features for compromised account detection is an additional challenge. To address these challenges, we propose an End-to-End Compromised Account Detection framework (E2ECAD). E2ECAD effectively captures temporal correlations via an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network. Further, it addresses the sparsity problem by defining and employing a user context representation. Meanwhile, informative network-related features are modeled efficiently. To verify the working of the framework, we construct a real-world dataset of compromised accounts on Twitter and conduct extensive experiments. The results of experiments show that E2ECAD outperforms the state of the art compromised account detection algorithms.","2473-991X","978-1-5386-6051-5","10.1109/ASONAM.2018.8508296","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8508296","","Feature extraction;Twitter;Computer hacking;Neural networks;Logic gates;Correlation","security of data;social networking (online)","safe media environment;secure social media environment;social media accounts;compromised account detection algorithms;end-to-end compromised account detection","","11","","31","","25 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This approach assumes that nodes interact via `forces' that derive from the `potential' that each node creates at the location of the other nodes, leading to a potential gradient that indicates the `natural' direction of diffusion through the network. A set of influencers in the network, is determined from strategically selected nodes based on the value of their net potential. We use synthetic networks of various sizes and compare the influence spread resulting from a seed set determined from the potential-based model and alternate approaches, including the greedy algorithm of Kempe et al. Our findings indicate that this approach achieves comparable results to those of the greedy algorithm without the prohibitive computational cost, and consistently outperforms the other approaches by a large margin.

Neuron spikes stimulate or inhibit spike activity in other neurons. Stock market shocks can trigger a contagion of volatility throughout a financial network. In these and other examples, only individual events associated with network nodes are observed, usually without the knowledge of the underlying dynamic relationships between nodes. This paper addresses the challenge of tracking how events within such networks stimulate or influence future events. The proposed approach is an online learning framework well-suited to streaming data, using a multivariate Hawkes point process model to encapsulate autoregressive features of observed events within the social network. Recent work on online learning in dynamic environments is leveraged not only to exploit the dynamics within the underlying network, but also to track the network structure as it evolves.

Each piece of information appears in some nodes and spreads node by node over the underlying network. So, inferring network structures and analyzing information diffusion processes are required in various domains. In most cases the underlying network is hidden and we only observe the times in which nodes are infected by contagions. The vast majority of existing methods are parametric with the assumption that information diffusion patterns follow a particular distribution. In this paper, to tackle this problem, we propose a simple and non-parametric method that infers the networks topology given a set of cascades. We consider that there exists an unobserved network and we just observe the temporal diffusion events that occur over the edges of the network. First we extract all candidates edges in the network and after that we estimate weights and strength of these edges. In other words, we calculate the occurrence probability between each pair of nodes in all given cascades which is the pairwise transmission rate between that two nodes. The most dominant feature of our approach is having a very low time and computational complexity compared to the current approaches. In addition, as have not considered any assumptions on the information diffusion pattern, our proposed approach has the advantage of being more general and it can be used in various inferring network problems. In summary, experimental results show that not only our method can reach better or equal performance in comparison with baseline models but also it solves the problem in a simpler way with low time complexity.","","978-1-4673-9280-8","10.1109/ICCKE.2015.7365838","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7365838","Social networks;Information Diffusion;Inferring Network Structure;Information Cascades","Probabilistic logic;Measurement","computational complexity;information dissemination;probability;social networking (online);topology","lightweight method;unknown social network structure;probabilistic process;information diffusion process;nonparametric method;network topology;temporal diffusion event;pairwise transmission rate;computational complexity;time complexity","","","","26","","28 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Despite initial success in curbing the spread of diseases through a lockdown and rapid vaccine development, human lives are threatened by sudden outbreaks from new strains of the virus. This motivates the conceptualization of effective interdiction rules to inform human mobility in a manner that the damage to lives as well as the economy could be minimized. In this work, we present three interdiction rules that employ machine learning-based network inference on daily infected cases to infer the influence of contagion between neighboring zones. The proposed rules leverage network science concepts such as coloring and clustering to attain time-varying partial or complete travel restrictions. Through extensive simulation experiments, we show that these strategies yield lower infection spread than greedy and random migration-based tie elimination approaches as well as a balance between contagion mitigation and economic gain.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3095252","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CBET-1802588); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9475974","COVID-19;travel rule;machine learning;network science;graph coloring","Vaccines;COVID-19;Biological system modeling;Social factors;Human factors;Machine learning;Strain","diseases;greedy algorithms;health and safety;industrial economics;learning (artificial intelligence);production engineering computing;productivity","machine learning-based network inference;rules leverage network science concepts;greedy migration-based tie elimination;random migration-based tie elimination;COVID-19;infectious disease;global public health emergency;world health organization;industrial productivity;global food supply;rapid vaccine development;economic gain","","1","","45","CCBY","7 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper introduces CrowdTracing, a dynamic overcrowding detection system that encourages social-distancing and triggers an alert to venue, city council or facility managers in a dynamic and privacy-preserving manner. CrowdTracing utilises ubiquitous WiFi probing and density-based clustering techniques which can be performed in real-time to identify commonly crowded areas and assist in the estimation of excess gatherings. The proposed system can also be used to enable discovery of where social distancing rules are not being followed, enabling a rapid response, controlling or slowing down the spread of the virus.

Although it has been studied in the context of humans, it is also relevant to future intelligent cognitive systems, that could have the capability to update their disposition and strategy based on the influence of others. In this work we transfer concepts from social sciences to the computing sciences and examine the effect of peer influence on culture. We consider the notion of ""peer pressure"", being the combined effect from all an individual's neighbours exerting influence at the same time, and also through influence flowing from indirect sources. This approach is derived using Social Impact Theory. We benchmark this against the cultural polarisation model from Axelrod, which involves influence being restricted to dyadic interactions between agents. We find that peer pressure provides complex contagion with a significant impact on cultural evolution. Greater cultural diversity is maintained, with indirect paths mitigating this by effectively forming disruptive weak links. This reaffirms that maintaining diversity in social ties, as well as a wide breadth, supports the mitigation of cultural isolation and polarisation. The model provides a platform to explore culture in a wide range of further scenarios, including electronic, coalition and organisational contexts.","","978-1-7281-2711-8","10.1109/ICCC.2019.00030","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8816877","Computational Modelling;Cultural polarisation;Agent-based Modelling;Homophily","Cultural differences;Computational modeling;Social networking (online);Measurement;Peer-to-peer computing;Lattices;Cognitive systems","cognitive systems;cultural aspects;multi-agent systems;social sciences computing","peer influence;peer pressure;cultural polarisation model;dyadic interactions;cultural evolution;social ties;cultural isolation;social impact theory;cultural diversity;Axelrod model;intelligent cognitive systems;agent-based modelling","","1","","37","","29 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The hypothesis is that hand movements a person produces during a laughter episode are mimicked through equivalent or other hand movements other participants in the interaction produce when they laugh. To investigate this, we analysed mimicry at two levels of specificity during laughter and non-laughter periods in a playful triadic social interaction. Changes in mimicry rates over the whole interaction were analysed as well as possible leader-follower relationships. Results show that hand movement rates were varied and strongly dependent on group. Even though hand movement are more frequent during laughter, mimicry does not increase. Mimicry levels, however, increase over the course of a session indicating that familiarity and comfort may increase emotional contagion.","2156-8111","978-1-4799-9953-8","10.1109/ACII.2015.7344642","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7344642","mimicry;gesture;laughter;social interaction","Games;Mouth;Visualization;Electronic mail;Robots;Context;Observers","behavioural sciences computing;emotion recognition","people affiliation;robots behaviour;virtual characters;nonlaughter periods;playful triadic social interaction;leader-follower relationships;hand movement rates;mimicry levels;emotional contagion;social signals;laughter expression;gesture mimicry","","3","","27","","7 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Using the data, from its inception on March 6, 2020, to June 10, 2020. In our case, in Peru, It has been forecast that the disease will peak, on the contagion curve, at 160-day from the first case. The total duration of the disease is approximately 15 months (450 days), the number of deceases will be approximately 1% of the entire population, and the total number of infected will reach approximately 85% of the population. The evolution of the parameters β, γ and μ show that the disease always tends to disappear, since they are directly related to the population and the condition of the individuals (Susceptible, Infected or Recovered). These parameters control the model, however, it is not trivial to be able to establish adequate values over time, since it will largely depend on the culture of the population mainly, and the policies that the government proposes, and in which way the population will comply with these policies to control the evolution of the pandemic. For example, one way to control the parameter β is compulsory social isolation with a strict epidemiological stratified fence by cities, thereby reducing the value of the contagion rate to zero and allowing the pandemic to be effectively controlled. However, in Peru, this control has not been achieved, since the population is very varied in its culture and quite reluctant to comply with the government's recommendations.","","978-1-6654-1560-6","10.1109/CLEI52000.2020.00062","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9458390","Epidemiological model;Epidemic;Infectious diseases;SIR;SEIR;SEIRS","COVID-19;Coronaviruses;Statistics;Sociology;Pandemics;Silicon;Indexes","diseases;microorganisms","government recommendations;contagion rate;strict epidemiological stratified fence;parameters control;contagion curve;disease;SARS-CoV-2 virus;COVID-19;SIR epidemiological model;Peru;pandemic","","","","","","28 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

If a sequence of vertices burns all the vertices of a graph by following the graph burning process, then such a sequence is known as a burning sequence. The graph burning problem consists in finding a minimum length burning sequence for a given graph. The solution to this NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem helps quantify a graph’s vulnerability to contagion. This paper introduces a simple farthest-first traversal-based approximation algorithm for this problem over arbitrary graphs. We refer to this proposal as the Burning Farthest-First (BFF) algorithm. BFF runs in <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$O(n^{3})$ </tex-math></inline-formula> steps and has a tight approximation factor of <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$3-2/b(G)$ </tex-math></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$b(G)$ </tex-math></inline-formula> is the size of an optimal solution. The main attribute of BFF is that it has a better approximation factor than the state-of-the-art approximation algorithms for arbitrary graphs, which report an approximation factor of 3. Despite being simple, BFF proved practical when tested over some benchmark datasets.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3159695","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9734068","Approximation algorithms;farthest-first traversal;graph burning;information spreading;social contagion","Approximation algorithms;Optimization;Measurement;Licenses;Social networking (online);Urban areas;Search problems","","","","","","29","CCBY","14 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Previous studies have focused mainly on finding evidence of affect contagion in homophilic atmospheres. However, these studies have overlooked users' awareness of the sentiments they share and consume online. In this paper, we present an experiment with Twitter users that aims to help them better understand which emotions they experience on this social network. We introduce Tweet Moodifier (T-Moodifier), a Google Chrome extension that enables Twitter users to filter and make explicit (through colored visual marks) the emotional content in their News Feed. We compare behavioral changes between 55 participants and 5089 of their public “friends.” The comparison period spans from two weeks before installing T-Moodifier to one week thereafter. The results suggest that the use of T-Moodifier might help Twitter users increase their emotional awareness: T-Moodifier users who had access to emotional statistics about their posts produced a significantly higher percentage of neutral content. This behavioral change suggests that people could behave differently while using real-time mechanisms that increase their affect reflection. Also, post-experience, those who completed both pre- and post-surveys could assert more confidently the main emotions they shared and perceived on Twitter. This shows T-Moodifier's potential to effectively make users reflect on their News Feed.","2156-8111","978-1-7281-3888-6","10.1109/ACII.2019.8925533","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8925533","emotional awareness;social media;Twitter","Twitter;Feeds;Privacy;Atmosphere;Media;Visualization","emotion recognition;social networking (online);statistical analysis","online social networks;Twitter users;Tweet moodifier;behavioral change;T-Moodifier users;emotional statistics;homophilic atmospheres;Google Chrome extension","","1","","31","","9 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, estimating and evaluating their impact on society remains challenging, considering the numerous and closely tied aspects to examine. This article proposes a fine-grain modeling methodology for NPIs, based on high-order relationships between people and environments, mimicking direct and indirect contagion pathways over time. After assessing the ability of each intervention in controlling an epidemic propagation, we devise a multi-objective optimization framework, which, based on the epidemiological data, calculates the NPI combination that should be implemented to minimize the spread of an epidemic as well as the damage due to the intervention. Each intervention is thus evaluated through an agent-based simulation, considering not only the reduction in the fraction of infected but also to what extent its application damages the daily life of the population. We run experiments on three data sets, and the results illustrate how the application of NPIs should be tailored to the specific epidemic situation. They further highlight the critical importance of correctly implementing personal protective (e.g., using face masks) and sanitization measures to slow down a pathogen spreading, especially in crowded places.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3119459","European Union Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme(grant numbers:769872 (EMPATHIC),823907 (MENHIR)); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9567682","Agent-based modeling;complex networks;epidemic;high-order relationships;hypergraphs;non-pharmaceutical interventions","Mathematical models;Biological system modeling;Statistics;Sociology;Context modeling;Social networking (online);Pandemics","data analysis;drugs;epidemics;graph theory;medical computing;modelling;optimisation","hyper-graphs;pathogen spreading;data sets;epidemic control strategies;agent-based simulation;epidemiological data;multiobjective optimization framework;epidemic propagation;indirect contagion pathways;direct contagion pathways;high-order relationships;fine-grain modeling methodology;closely tied aspects;numerous tied aspects;drug treatments;severe outbreak;NPIs;nonpharmaceutical interventions;high-order temporal networks;sanitization measures;specific epidemic situation","","1","","73","CCBY","11 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Suppose that a disease or a rumor originating from a single source among a set of suspects spreads in a network, how to locate this disease/rumor source? This problem is crucial and challenging in different fields of computer or social networks, which is made more difficult in many applications where we have access only to a limited set of observations. We study the problem of estimating the origin of a disease/rumor outbreak: given a contact network and a snapshot of epidemic spread at a certain time, root out the infection source. Assuming that the epidemic spread follows the usual susceptible-infected (SI) model, we introduce an inference algorithm based on sparsely placed observers. We present an algorithm which utilizes the correlated information between the network structure (shortest paths) and the diffusion dynamics (time sequence of infection). The numerical results of artificial and empirical networks show that it leads to significant improvement of performance compared to existing approaches.

Before the 1970s, various businesses and economics could affect and improve technologies, and humans' life. Since we reached the 70ies, and with the beginning of the 3<sup>rd</sup> wave or the post-industrial era, the new modern technologies such as Information Technology (IT), Internet of Things (IoT), Internet of Business (IoB), Internet of Energy (IoE), Internet of Manufacturing (IoM), Internet of Health (IoH), the emerging digitization, and innovative smartness in addition, issues such as know-how, do-how, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and others could influence businesses, the economy, urban infrastructures, societies, social impacts and even human life. Wars, sanctions, sciences, technologies, IT, IoT, and smartness work together and have impacts on each other's, businesses, economy, and human life. Fundamentally, during humans' history inventions and innovations have been created through restrictions and challenges. Wars, sanctions, low sustainability, risks of contagion, recessions, climate pollution, environmental change, biodiversity collapse, urban sprawl, growing urbanizations, lack of infrastructure, gentrification, economic instabilities, and recently health crises are introduced as main restrictions. Wars and welfare integrate with human's life desirably or undesirably and make innovation. Improvement through such innovative digital technologies are so admirable because most of them have changed the world. Sustainability has an important role for societies and urbans to improve their quality of livability and life. The world academic economy has changed from an academic SocioEdu economy to a data and innovative academic SocioEdu, ecosystem and economy, leading to the concept of the ""Internet of Business-Education"". with many popular IoT applications involved (i.e. wearables, smart city, smart society, smart healthcare, smart welfare, smart SMEs, smart retail, smart supply chain). This pandemic throws a spotlight on the interdependencies among business, nature, society, economy, and education. It may be tempting right now, when it is hard to see beyond the next few weeks, to dismiss the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as a distraction. But they have been described as a ""crowd-sourced purchase order from the future"" precisely because they offer a tremendous business opportunity. Based on SDGs all developed and developing countries in a global partnership have to go with CSR strategies and Hybrid Businesses for improving social cohesion and welfare, health, education, inequality, blue-green environmental sustainability, and economic efficiency.

Using an agent-based modeling framework, we study agent behavior in the spread of competing rumors through an endogenous costly exercise of measured networked interactions whereby agents update their position, opinion or belief with respect to a rumor, and attempt to influence peers through interactions, uniquely shaping group behavior in the spread of rumors. It should be pointed out that this research is still in its nascent stages and much needs to be further investigated. Our initial findings, however, suggest that (i) rumors can survive under competition even with low adopting populations, (ii) latent positions in rumors seem to dominate extreme positions, and (iii) the timing of the effort expended by an agent affects the level of competition between rumors.","1558-4305","978-1-4673-9743-8","10.1109/WSC.2015.7408553","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7408553","","Media;Sociology;Statistics;Stochastic processes;Position measurement;Social network services;Diseases","","","","9","","22","","18 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Asymptotic stability analysis of the all-adopt as well as the none-adopt equilibria of the combined opinion-adoption model is provided through the use of Lyapunov arguments. In doing so, sufficient conditions are provided which determine the stability of the “flop” state, where no one adopts the product and everyone's opinion of the product is least favorable, and the “hit” state, where everyone adopts and their opinions are most favorable. These conditions are shown to extend to the bounded confidence opinion dynamic under a stronger assumption on the model parameters. Additional analysis is provided for the case where the product is neither a hit nor a flop.

Global behaviors generally emerge from the interplay between the structure of the interconnection topology and the local agents' interactions. We focus on the Threshold Model (TM) of cascades first introduced by Granovetter (1978). This can be interpreted as the best response dynamics in a network game whereby agents choose strategically between two actions. Each agent is equipped with an individual threshold representing the number of her neighbors who must have adopted a certain action for that to become the agent's best response. We analyze the TM dynamics on large-scale networks with heterogeneous agents. Through a local mean-field approach, we obtain a nonlinear, one-dimensional, recursive equation that approximates the evolution of the TM dynamics on most of the networks of a given size and distribution of degrees and thresholds. We prove that, on all but a fraction of networks with given degree and threshold statistics that is vanishing as the network size grows large, the actual fraction of adopters of a given action is arbitrarily close to the output of the aforementioned recursion. Numerical simulations on some real network testbeds show good adherence to the theoretical predictions.","2327-4697","","10.1109/TNSE.2017.2777941","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8120135","Cascades;social networks;threshold model;coordination game;best response;random graphs;local mean-field","Sociology;Statistics;Biological system modeling;Network topology;Games;Mathematical model;Numerical simulation","complex networks;financial management;game theory;graph theory;multi-agent systems;network theory (graphs);nonlinear equations;numerical analysis;statistical analysis","threshold statistics;network size;network testbeds;large-scale networks;social networks;economic networks;cascading mechanisms;contagion dynamics;financial networks;global behaviors;interconnection topology;response dynamics;network game;TM dynamics;heterogeneous agents;local agent interactions;threshold model;local mean-field approach;nonlinear one-dimensional recursive equation;numerical simulations","","10","","34","IEEE","27 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Opinion propagation in a project is treated as a kind of complex contagions, which means one need sufficient social enhancement to change one's own opinion. Majority rule (MR) is improved by taking into account the existence of a threshold of opinion transition of individuals, which characterizes the human nature of sticking to one's own opinion to a certain extent, so as to remedy the defect of the Lambiotte model's assumption that individuals preferentially follow the crowed in their opinion update (e.g. herding behaviours in public choices). A phase diagram about the opinion evolution in the two groups is obtained where there are three regimes, and the self-organization phenomena and its features are discovered in regime 2. While the emergence of a dominate opinion may take place in this regime without managers' intervention, it is clear that the dominate opinion is unpredictable. The simulation results also validate the necessity of the opinion induction by project organizers to promote the formation of positive public opinion in the whole organization.","2157-9563","978-1-4244-9953-3","10.1109/ICNC.2011.6022419","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6022419","project management;opinion evolution;complex contagion;couple random network;self-organization;network dynamics","Fluctuations;Organizations;Communities;Trajectory;Computational modeling;Social network services;Analytical models","cognition;construction;project management","coupled random network model;opinion dynamics;mega construction project;opinion propagation;majority rule;opinion transition;Lambiotte model;self-organization phenomena","","","","22","","19 Sep 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We first show that in the absence of any knowledge about the contagion network, an adversary that tries to predict the real values from perturbed ones, cannot train a classifier that achieves an area under the ROC curve (AUC) above 1-(1-δ)/(1+e<sup>ε</sup>), if the dataset is perturbed using an (ε,δ)-differentially private mechanism. Then, we show that with the knowledge of the contagion network and model, one can do substantially better. We demonstrate that our method passes the performance limit imposed by differential privacy.

Immunization is an important problem in multiple different domains like epidemiology, public health, cyber security and social media. Additionally, clearly immunization at group scale (like schools and communities) is more realistic due to constraints in implementations and compliance (e.g., it is hard to ensure specific individuals take the adequate vaccine). Hence efficient algorithms for such a ""group-based"" problem can help public-health experts take more practical decisions. However most prior work has looked into individual-scale immunization. In this paper, we study the problem of controlling propagation at group scale. We formulate novel so-called Group Immunization problems for multiple natural settings (for both threshold and cascade-based contagion models under both node-level and edge-level interventions) and develop multiple efficient algorithms, including provably approximate solutions.

The problem of devising a strategy to facilitate or block such process has received a considerable amount of attention. A major challenge therein is that the underlying network of diffusion is often hidden. Most researchers dealing with this issue assume only one underlying network over which cascades spread. However, in the real world, whether the transmission pathways of a contagion, a piece of information, emerge or not depends on many factors, such as the topic of the information and the time when the information is first mentioned. In our opinion, it is impractical to model the diffusion processes by using only a single network when information is of all kind and diffuses in different underlying topic-specific networks. In this paper, we formulate a problem of K-network inference, inferring K underlying diffusion networks, based on a proposed probabilistic generative mixture model that models the generation of cascades. We further propose an algorithm that could cluster similar cascades and infer the corresponding underlying network for each cluster in the Expectation-Maximization framework. Finally, in experiments, we show that our algorithm could cluster cascades and infer the underlying networks effectively.","","978-1-4799-5877-1","10.1109/ASONAM.2014.6921597","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6921597","Diffusion;Clustering;Social Network","Ions","expectation-maximisation algorithm;inference mechanisms;information dissemination;network theory (graphs)","cluster cascades;multiple underlying networks;diffusion data;information diffusion;virus propagation;transmission pathways;topic-specific networks;K-network inference;probabilistic generative mixture model;expectation-maximization framework","","3","","12","","16 Oct 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This problem is important and challenging in different contexts of computer or social networks, which is made more difficult in many applications where we have access only to a limited set of observations. We study the problem of estimating the origin of a rumor/epidemic outbreak: given a contact network and a snapshot of epidemic spread at a certain time, determine the infection source.

The optimal cascade seeding problem is combinatorial and thus intractable for large networks. We propose an approximation of the threshold model that lends itself to the application of tools from dynamical systems theory and convex optimization. Through a sequence of relaxations we write the approximate optimal cascade seeding problem as a linear program, which has the benefit of scaling gracefully in network size. Our approach retains the original network topology and accommodates the specification of a wide range of additional constraints on the initialization and propagation of failures, such as which nodes are immune from initial failure and which are required to be in failed state by the end of the time horizon.","","978-1-5090-2873-3","10.1109/CDC.2017.8263650","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8263650","Boolean networks;cascading behavior;convex optimization;diffusion of innovations;epidemics;linear programming;reweighted ℓ1;social contagion;sparsity;threshold model;viral marketing","Network topology;Optimization;Linear matrix inequalities;Power system faults;Power system protection;Linear programming;Convex functions","approximation theory;convex programming;failure analysis;linear programming;network theory (graphs)","linear programming approach;optimal seeding;cascading failures;threshold model;specified time horizon;time zero;final failures;initial failures;dynamical systems theory;convex optimization;approximate optimal cascade seeding problem;network size;network topology;failure propagation;failure initialization","","2","","22","","22 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These effects are particularly relevant in domains such as teaching, sports, exercise and healthy eating; domains increasingly targeted by socially assistive robotics. As such, we suggest socially assistive robots may benefit from affective communication in the same way as their human counterparts. We show that emotion recognition from robot voice and motion is possible in explicit validation experiments but does not hold in a socially assistive interaction. Our findings suggest that robot to human IET relies on the human having an expectation for, and hence recognition of, robot emotions; mimicry of valanced motion is not sufficient.","1944-9437","978-1-5386-3518-6","10.1109/ROMAN.2017.8172368","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8172368","","Robots;Emotion recognition;Speech;Videos;Speech recognition;Appraisal","emotion recognition;human computer interaction;human-robot interaction","emotion recognition;robot voice;socially assistive interaction;human IET;robot emotions;world impact;emotion portrayal;human-robot interaction;umbrella term;human-human interaction;emotion contagion;social appraisal effects;socially assistive robotics;human counterparts;human interpersonal emotion transfer","","6","","45","","14 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An important aspect of individual behaviour is emotion which plays a significant role in all aspects of human decision making. For example, heightened emotional states can lead people to take highly unexpected or irrational actions. One popular motivation for simulation of virtual crowds is to generate believable characters in movies and computer games. Recently the concept of serious games has been introduced in both academic and industrial circles. In this paper, we propose an emotion engine, based on modern appraisal theory, that is able to model various emotional crowd characteristics. This appraisal engine is capable of capturing the dynamics of emotional contagion and we show how different crowd composition can lead to different patterns of emotional contagion. In addition, we describe a serious game designed for training military personnel in peaceful crowd control. We evaluate this engine in the context of a property protection protest scenario where the players or soldiers are tasked to maintain a peaceful protest without violence. A systematic evaluation is presented which supports the facial validity of the emotion engine and our model of emotional contagion.","","978-1-4577-1373-6","10.1109/WI-IAT.2011.154","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6040757","Emotion Modelling;Crowd Simulation;Serious Games","Appraisal;Engines;Games;Computational modeling;Humans;Pattern matching;Context","computer based training;computer games;decision making;military computing;multi-agent systems;virtual reality","computational model;agent-based crowds;serious games;crowd behaviour;human decision making;virtual crowd simulation;computer games;emotion engine;appraisal theory;emotional crowd characteristics;appraisal engine;emotional contagion;military personnel training;property protection protest scenario;soldiers","","14","","16","","10 Oct 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Understanding mimicry is important for building better robots, learning about human categorization of robots in social ingroups/outgroups, and understanding social contagion in human-robot interaction. We investigate the extent to which humans will mimic a robot during the task of describing paintings by comparing the time participants put their hands on their hips before and after observing a robot cue that behavior. We observed no significant difference in participants' hands on hips time before and after the robot's cue. However, we did find that some participants performed the behavior more after the robot's cue while others performed it less. Furthermore, the direction of this change was a function of whether or not a participant performed the specified behavior prior to the robot's cue. This was similarly observed both for frequency of behavior performance and for a second behavior (hands behind back). As such, this study informs future research on human-robot mimicry, particularly on the importance of prior behavior during a human-robot interaction. In doing so, this study provides a baseline for further understanding and exploring mimicry in human-robot interaction as well as evidence for a social component in human-robot mimicry.","1944-9437","978-1-5090-3929-6","10.1109/ROMAN.2016.7745239","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7745239","","Painting;Hip;Educational robots;Human-robot interaction;Atmospheric measurements;Particle measurements","humanoid robots;human-robot interaction","human mimicry;robots;motor movements;human-robot interaction;social ingroups;social outgroups","","4","","35","","17 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In actual-world societies,the balance between personal and social interests is self-regulated through social conventions that emerge in a decentralized manner. As such, a computational mechanism that allows to engineer the emergence of social conventions in MAS can become a highly promising tool to endow open MAS with self-regulating capabilities. To this end we propose a computational self-adapting mechanism that facilitates agents to distributively evolve their social behavior to reach the best social conventions. Our approach borrows from the social contagion phenomenon: social conventions are akin to infectious diseases that spread themselves through members of the society. Furthermore, we experimentally show that our mechanism helps a MAS to regulate itself by searching and establishing (better) social conventions on a wide range of interaction topologies and dynamic environments.","1949-3681","978-0-7695-3404-6","10.1109/SASO.2008.65","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4663420","emergence;conventions;self-adaptation;MAS;distributed intelligence","Complex networks;Diseases;Technological innovation;Network topology;Autonomous agents;Multiagent systems;Artificial intelligence;Councils;Distributed computing;Computer viruses","distributed processing;multi-agent systems","infection-based mechanism;multiagent complex networks;distributed mechanisms;multiagent systems;social conventions;interaction topologies","","7","","20","","31 Oct 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, “social signals,” such as product purchase time, or blog entry timestamps are measurable, and implicitly depend on the underlying topology, making it possible to track it over time. Interestingly, network topologies often “jump” between discrete states that may account for sudden changes in the observed signals. The present paper advocates a switched dynamic structural equation model to capture the topology dependent cascade evolution, as well as the discrete states driving the underlying topologies. Conditions under which the proposed switched model is identifiable are established. Leveraging the edge sparsity inherent to social networks, a recursive ℓ<sub>1</sub>-norm regularized least-squares estimator is put forth to jointly track the states and network topologies. An efficient first-order proximal-gradient algorithm is developed to solve the resulting optimization problem. Numerical experiments on both synthetic data and real cascades measured over the span of one year are conducted, and test results corroborate the efficacy of the advocated approach.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2016.2628354","ARO(grant numbers:W911NF-15-1-0492); NSF(grant numbers:1343248,1442686,1514056); NIH(grant numbers:1R01GM104975-01); AFOSR-MURI(grant numbers:FA9550-10-1-0567); European Union; Greek national funds; National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF); THALES; ESF; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7742937","Social networks;structural equation model;network cascade;topology inference;switched linear systems","Network topology;Switches;Integrated circuits;Topology;Mathematical model;Power system dynamics;Numerical analysis","estimation theory;gradient methods;least squares approximations;optimisation;switching networks;telecommunication network topology","optimization problem;first-order proximalgradient algorithm;recursive l1-norm regularized least-squares estimator;edge sparsity leveraging;topology dependent cascade evolution;switched dynamic structural equation model;blog entry timestamp;product purchase time;infectious disease;information cascade;tracking switched dynamic network topology","","24","","27","IEEE","14 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

SIR assumes individuals acquire full immunity to the infection after recovery, while SIS assumes individuals acquire no immunity after recovery. However, in many spreading processes individuals may acquire only partial immunity to the infection or may become more susceptible to reinfection after recovery. We study a model for reinfection called Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Infected (SIRI). The SIRI model generalizes the SIS and SIR models and allows for study of systems in which the susceptibility of agents changes irreversibly after first exposure to the infection. We show that when the rate of reinfection is higher than the rate of primary infection, the SIRI model exhibits bistability with a small difference in the initial fraction of infected individuals determining whether the infection dies out or spreads through the population. We find this critical value and show that when the infection does not die out there is a resurgent epidemic in which the number of infected individuals decays initially and remains at a low level for an arbitrarily long period of time before rapidly increasing toward an endemic equilibrium in which the fraction of infected individuals is non-zero.","2475-1456","","10.1109/LCSYS.2018.2832063","ONR(grant numbers:N00014-14-1-0635); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8353159","Nonlinear systems;contagion dynamics;compartmental systems","Silicon;Sociology;Statistics;Immune system;Analytical models;Steady-state;Biological system modeling","complex networks;diseases;epidemics","immunity;susceptibility;primary infection;reinfection models;bistability;resurgent epidemics;susceptible-infected-recovered-infected ]model;SIRI model","","7","","17","IEEE","1 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A key predictor of social contagion is the multiplicity of social contexts inside the individual's contact neighborhood, which is termed structural diversity. However, the existing models have limited decomposability for analyzing large-scale networks, and suffer from the inaccurate reflection of social context diversity. In this paper, we propose a new truss-based structural diversity model to overcome the weak decomposability. Based on this model, we study a novel problem of truss-based structural diversity search in a graph G, that is, to find the r vertices with the highest truss-based structural diversity and return their social contexts. To tackle this problem, we propose an online structural diversity search algorithm in O(<formula><tex>$\rho$</tex></formula>(m + T)) time, where <formula><tex>$\rho$</tex></formula>, m, and T are respectively the arboricity, the number of edges, and the number of triangles in G. To improve the efficiency, we design an elegant and compact index, called TSD-index, for further expediting the search process. Our TSD-index-based algorithm finds answers in O(m) time. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our model and algorithms, against state-of-the-art methods.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2020.3027950","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9210126","Structural Diversity;Top-k Search;TSD-index;k-truss Mining","Cultural differences;Context modeling;Indexes;Search problems;Analytical models;Facebook","","","","","","","IEEE","30 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

These platforms (e.g., YouTube, Vimeo) have already begun to supplant television day by day. However, some content creators use irrelevant and eye-catching titles (clickbait) that do not correspond to the video’s original content. This video title increases video engagement or view counts and ad revenue but wastes viewers’ valuable time. These videos are spreading like a contagion in the video-sharing platforms. In this research, we have targeted to solve this issue by identifying clickbait videos by creating a dataset containing video titles (Bangla, English, and Phonetic Bangla) and numerical features. We have adopted various feature extraction techniques for proper analysis and applied Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, and Gradient Boost algorithm to create classification models. Remarkably, both the Decision Tree and Gradient Boost models have accomplished a 99% accuracy score in detecting clickbait videos.","","978-1-6654-3843-8","10.1109/ACMI53878.2021.9528095","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9528095","Clickbait Video Identification;Video Sharing Platform;Bangla NLP;Machine Learning","Machine learning algorithms;TV;Multimedia Web sites;Support vector machine classification;Machine learning;Phonetics;Feature extraction","decision trees;feature extraction;information analysis;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;pattern classification;regression analysis;search engines;social networking (online);support vector machines;video signal processing","video sharing platforms;video-sharing platforms;eye-catching titles;video title;video engagement;clickbait videos","","","","19","","8 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Examples include the rise of collective action to join a riot and diffusion of beliefs, norms, and cultural fads, to name a few. Most existing works on modeling influence propagation consider a single content (e.g., an opinion, decision, product, political view, etc.) spreading over a network independent from everything else. However, most real-life examples involve multiple correlated contents spreading simultaneously and exhibiting positive (e.g., opinions on same-sex marriage and gun control) or negative (e.g., opinions on universal health care and tax-relief for the “rich”) correlation. To accommodate these cases, this paper proposes the vector threshold model, as an extension of the widely used Watts threshold model for complex contagions. Here, the state of a node is represented by a binary vector representing their opinion on a number of content items. Nodes switch their states based on the influence they receive from their neighbors in the network. The influence is represented by a vector containing the proportion of neighbors who support each content; both positively and negatively correlated contents can be captured in this formulation by using different rules for switching node states. Our main result is concerned with the expected size of global cascades, i.e., cases where a randomly chosen node can initiate a propagation that eventually reaches a positive fraction of the whole population. We also derive conditions on network structure for global cascades to be possible. Analytic results are supported by a numerical study.","1938-1883","978-1-5386-8088-9","10.1109/ICC.2019.8761313","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8761313","","Correlation;Numerical models;Medical services;Analytical models;Switches;Sociology","complex networks;network theory (graphs);social sciences;vectors","vector threshold model;simultaneous spread;correlated influence;collective action;influence propagation;network independent;multiple correlated contents;universal health care;binary vector;content items;negatively correlated contents;propagation process;Watts threshold model","","","","22","","15 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We study the effect of both smooth dependancies and discontinuities of the contact rate. In the first case, we prove the existence of a threshold phenomenon that generalizes the well-known dichotomy associated to the reproduction rate parameter in the classical SIR model.

A basic and crucial point for any energy company is how much energy to buy. That is, determining the amount of energy to be purchased as close as possible to that needed to serve its customers, avoiding financial losses by consuming more or less than they have. However, this is not a trivial problem, as energy consumption depends on several exogenous and endogenous factors, such as all the problems previously mentioned, in addition to economic, social, climatic, political and cultural aspects, among others. Thus, energy forecasts are realized with aid of both statistical analyzes and computational techniques. This article exposes a very short and short term energy forecast model using Neural Networks and feedback, applied in the new global context: the new coronavirus pandemic and its implications for energy consumption. The method was implemented with a real consumption dataset provided by the Brazilian energy company Equatorial from Para State and from Maranhao State. Very short term energy forecasts results reached a MAPE of around 1.2% in a 15-day window for both States, Para and Maranhao. For short term energy forecasts, results for both States were 3 possible scenarios in a window from June to December 2020, due to the unpredictability of the pandemic, especially in Brazil, which so far has shown no signs of reducing the contagion curve.","2573-0770","978-1-7281-9953-5","10.1109/ROPEC50909.2020.9258775","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9258775","Energy Forecast;Energy Market;Neural Networks;Coronavirus Pandemic","Neurons;Companies;Predictive models;Pandemics;Energy consumption;Data models;Computational modeling","cost reduction;distributed power generation;energy consumption;feedback;neural nets;power distribution economics;power engineering computing;power generation economics;power generation planning;power grids;power markets;profitability;statistical analysis","RNA model;new coronavirus pandemic context;power grid expansions;distributed generation;energy market customers migrations;commercial losses;power distribution companies;energy quality;MAPE;Maranhao State;Para State;feedback;neural networks;computational techniques;statistical analysis;profitability;costs reductions;Brazilian energy company;short term energy forecast model;political aspects;climatic aspects;social aspects;economic aspects;endogenous factors;exogenous factors;energy consumption;financial losses","","","","21","","25 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper uses the daily closing price data of the 28 level-1 sectors from Shenyin & Wanguo Securities ranging from 2000 to 2017 to study the information transmission between different sectors. We construct information flow networks with the sectors as the nodes and the transfer entropy between them as the corresponding edges. Then we adopt the maximum spanning arborescence (MSA) to extract important information flows and the hierarchical structure of the networks. We find that, during the whole sample period, the composite sector is an information source of the whole stock market, while the non-bank financial sector is the information sink. We also find that the non-bank finance, bank, computer, media, real estate, medical biology and non-ferrous metals sectors appear as high-degree root nodes in the outgoing and incoming information flow MSAs. Especially, the non-bank finance and bank sectors have significantly high degrees after 2008 in the outgoing information flow networks. We uncover how stock market turmoils affect the structure of the MSAs. Finally, we reveal the specificity of information source and sink sectors and make a conclusion that the root node sector acts as the information sink of the incoming information flow networks.

Every moment, the hands are used to greet people and handle objects, but shortly thereafter, it is common to use them to touch the face. Such an involuntary action can take all kinds of harmful agents into our bodies. Hence, this work aims to present and share the development of a low cost bracelet that helps the user not to touch the face with the hands. As a result, it is expected to reduce the spread of this virus through this type of contagion. For this, the bracelet monitors the position of the hands and issues an alert when it detects the approach of the hand to the face as a warning to the user not do this. Initially, a first prototype was made to observe local public (state of Alagoas-Brazil) interest in the product. This way, there were a positive feedback from public. The sequence of the project was extended in the development of the product such a way that it can be used by the final public in risky regions. Due to its low cost, this bracelet can be used by people from underdeveloped countries like Brazil, and countries in Africa to stop practicing this harmful habit for their health. In this sense, some financial grants for Humanitarian relief efforts can be considered. Thanks to government funding, 500 bracelet units are being made for donation to the state of Alagoas, Brazil. It is important to mention that the objective of this work is not to replace the existing preventing methods, but to offer a bracelet proposition to come as an extra support to reduce even more that risk to contract COVID-19. Hence, the solution can be added with all other existing in order to decrease even more the chances of contracting COVID-19. Therefore, the social distance, the use ofmasks and a good hand hygiene are still the safest way to avoid COVID-19. However, our bracelet can help people to avoid the eye touching, such habit can lead to COVID-19 that traditional low cost cotton masks do not protect and is more comfortably for hours of use than face shields.","1548-0992","","10.1109/TLA.2021.9451252","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9451252","smart band;COVID-19;low cost","COVID-19;Three-dimensional displays;Software;Neurons;Faces;Solid modeling;Integrated circuit modeling","biomedical equipment;biomedical measurement;disasters;health care;humanities;hygiene;patient diagnosis","COVID-19 prevention;World Health Organization;Brazilian National Health Surveillance Agency;harmful agents;positive feedback;harmful habit;bracelet proposition;good hand hygiene;traditional low cost cotton masks;face shields;bracelet units;low-cost bracelet;low-cost smartband;contamination second wave;humanitarian relief efforts;state-of-Alagoas","","","","","","10 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we propose a ‘generalized SIS model’ by allowing the existence of intermediate states between susceptible and infected states. To analyse the diffusion process of the generalized SIS model on large graphs, we use the ‘mean-field analysis technique’ to determine which initial condition leads to or prevents the outbreak of information or virus. For any general connected graphs, we show that the condition which can prevent the spread of contagions depends on two de-coupled effects: the network topology and the parametric values of the generalized SIS model. Experimental results based on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that our methodology can accurately predict the behaviour of the phase-transition process for any general graphs. We also extend our generalized SIS model to analyse the dynamics and behaviour of two competing sources. This is useful if one wants to model competing products in a large network or competition between virus and antidote in a large communication network. We present the analytical derivation and show via experiment how different factors such as initial condition, transmission rates, recovery rates or the number of states can affect the phase transition process and the final equilibrium. Our models and methodology can serve as an essential tool in analysing and understanding the information diffusion process in large networks.","2051-1329","","10.1093/comnet/cnu027","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8150044","models of complex networks;applications of complex network analysis;complex networks and epidemics;generalized SIS model;tipping point;competing sources","","","","","2","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We already witnessed the loss of economy and daily life through the lockdown. In addition, vaccine, medication, and treatment strategies take clinical trials, so there is a need to tracking and tracing approach. Suitably, exhibiting and computing social evolution is critical for refining the epidemic, but maybe crippled by location data ineptitude of inaccessibility. It is complex and time consuming to identify and detect the chain of virus spread from one person to another through the terabytes of spatiotemporal GPS data. The proposed research aims a HPE edge line computing and big data analytic supported virus outbreak tracing and tracking approach that consumes terabytes of spatiotemporal data. Proposed STRENUOUS system discovers the prospect of applying an individual’s mobility to label mobility streams and forecast a virus-like COVID-19 epidemic transmission. The method and the mechanical assembly further contained an alert component to demonstrate a suspected case if there was a potential exposure with the confirmed subject. The proposed system tracks location data related to a suspected subject in the confirmed subject route, where the location data expresses one or more geographic locations of each user over a period. It recognizes a subcategory of the suspected subject who is expected to transmit a contagion based on the location data. System measure an exposure level of a carrier to the infection based on contaminated location data and a subset of carriers connected with the second location carrier. They investigated whether the people in the confirmed subject’s cross-path can be infected and suggest quarantine followed by testing. The Proposed STRENUOUS system produces a report specifying that the people have been exposed to the virus.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2022.3147428","Eurotech 2020(grant numbers:754462); REACH H2020(grant numbers:690425); ARC ITRH for Digital Enhances Living(grant numbers:IH170100013); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9695959","Edge line computing;GPS big data;spatiotemporal data;IIoT;AI;health informatics.","Viruses (medical);Coronaviruses;Global Positioning System;COVID-19;Spatiotemporal phenomena;Diseases;Servers","","","","","","","IEEE","28 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

This type of online collective contagion has given numerous advantages to society, for example, giving consolation and crisis administration in the quick fallout of catastrophic events. Be that as it may likewise represents a potential hazard to powerless Web clients who get this data and could consequently come to hurt. One example is the spread of suicidal ideation in online Social network like Twitter, which has risen in concern. In this Survey paper, we report the consequences and results of various machine classifiers worked with the point of arranging text identifying with suicide on Twitter. The classifier recognizes the more stressing content, for example, suicidal ideation, and other suicide related points, for example, detailing of a suicide, dedication, campaigning and bolster. It aims to refer and identify flippant references to suicide by using baseline classifier using emotive, lexical, psychological, and structural features from twitter. In this survey clustering, classification, martingale function, association rule, Natural language processing (NLP) and different machine learning techniques are used. This paper further discusses about the research challenges in this domain that initiates the scope for further research.","","978-1-5386-7799-5","10.1109/ISS1.2019.8907987","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8907987","Machine Learning;Suicide ideation;Twitter analysis;automated methods;NLP;classification methods","Twitter;Vocabulary;Conferences;Machine learning;Sociology","","","","2","","67","","21 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
