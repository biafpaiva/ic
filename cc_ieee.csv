"Complex contagions and hybrid phase transitions","J. C. Miller",NA,"Journal of Complex Networks","18 Jan 2018","2016","4","2","201","223","A complex contagion is an infectious process in which individuals may require multiple transmissions before changing state. These are used to model behaviours if an individual only adopts a particular behaviour after perceiving a consensus among others. We may think of individuals as beginning inactive and becoming active once they are contacted by a sufficient number of active partners. These have been studied in a number of cases, but analytic models for the dynamic spread of complex contagions are typically complex. Here we study the dynamics of the Watts threshold model (WTM) assuming that transmission occurs in continuous time as a Poisson process, or in discrete time where individuals transmit to all partners in the time step following their infection. We adapt techniques developed for infectious disease modelling to develop an analyse analytic models for the dynamics of the WTM in configuration model networks and a class of random clustered (triangle-based) networks. The resulting model is relatively simple and compact. We use it to gain insights into the dynamics of the contagion. Taking the infinite population limit, we derive conditions under which cascades happen with an arbitrarily small initial proportion active, confirming a hypothesis of Watts for this case. We also observe hybrid phase transitions when cascades are not possible for small initial conditions, but occur for large enough initial conditions. We derive sufficient conditions for this hybrid phase transition to occur. We show that in many cases, if the hybrid phase transition occurs, then all individuals eventually become active. Finally, we discuss the role clustering plays in facilitating or impeding the spread and find that the hypothesis of Watts that was confirmed in configuration model networks does not hold in general. This approach allows us to unify many existing disparate observations and derive new results.","2051-1329","","10.1093/comnet/cnv021","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8155909","Watts threshold model;cascades;hybrid bifurcation;complex contagion;dynamic model","","","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

However, the effects of the heterogeneous adoption thresholds on complex contagions in weighted networks have not been systematically investigated. In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous complex contagion model on the weighted network, in which individuals have different adoption thresholds. For individuals with a relatively small adoption threshold, they are more likely to adopt the contagion and act as activists. An edge-weight based compartmental theory is developed to unveil spreading dynamics. Through extensive numerical simulations and theoretical analysis, we find that, for any weight distribution heterogeneity, with the increase of the activist fraction, the growth pattern of the final adoption size versus the information spreading probability changes from hybrid phase transition to a second-order continuous phase transition. Meanwhile, increasing the activist fraction can promote behavior spreading. Through bifurcation analysis, we discover that changing the heterogeneity of the weight distribution will not change the type of phase transition. Besides, reducing weight distribution heterogeneity can facilitate behavior spreading. Extensive numerical simulations verify that the theoretical solutions coincide with the numerical results very well.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2984615","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61801044,61803106); China Postdoctoral Science Special Foundation(grant numbers:2019T120829); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (CPSF)(grant numbers:2018M631073); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Sichuan Science and Technology Program(grant numbers:20YYJC4001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9051808","Complex contagions;heterogeneous adoption;weighted networks;threshold model;compartmental theory","Social networking (online);Numerical models;Numerical simulation;Information processing;Epidemics;Correlation;Complex networks","bifurcation;network theory (graphs);probability;social network theory;social sciences","bifurcation analysis;information spreading probability;behavior spreading;second-order continuous phase transition;activist fraction;weight distribution heterogeneity;edge-weight based compartmental theory;heterogeneous complex contagion model;network science;complex contagions;adoption threshold heterogeneity;weighted network;complex social contagions","","","","55","CCBY","31 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We formulate various problems to minimize contagion spread and show that some are efficiently solvable while others are formally hard. We also compare our hardness results to those from node blocking problems and show interesting differences between the two. Our main problem is not only hard, but also has no approximation guarantee, unless P=NP. Therefore, we devise a heuristic for the problem and compare its performance to state-of-the-art heuristics from the literature.

Most existing works focus on contagions where individuals' states are represented by binary variables, and propagation takes place over a single isolated network. However, characterization of an individual's standing on a given matter as a binary state might be overly simplistic as most of our opinions, feelings, and perceptions vary over more than two states. Also, most real-world contagions take place over multiple networks (e.g., Twitter and Facebook) or involve multiplex networks where individuals engage in different types of relationships (e.g., acquaintance, coworker, family, etc.). To this end, this paper studies multistage complex contagions that take place over multilayer or multiplex networks. Under a linear threshold based contagion model, we first give analytic results for the expected size of global cascades, that is, cases where a randomly chosen node can initiate a propagation that eventually reaches a positive fraction of the whole population. Next, we analytically derive the probability of triggering global cascades. Then, analytic results are confirmed and supported by an extensive numerical study. In addition, we demonstrate how the dynamics of complex contagions is affected by the extra weight exerted by hyperactive nodes and by the structural properties of the networks. In particular, we reveal an interesting connection between the assortativity of a network and the impact of hyperactive nodes on the cascade size.","2325-5870","","10.1109/TCNS.2019.2923388","National Foundation(grant numbers:CCF-1813637); Army Research Office(grant numbers:W911NF-17-1-0587); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8737745","Complex networks;computational modeling;communication networks;facebook;network topology;numerical models;sociology","Multiplexing;Facebook;Analytical models;Color;Control systems;Twitter","complex networks;network theory (graphs);probability;random processes;social network theory","hyperactive nodes;probability;multistage complex contagions;random multiplex networks;linear threshold based contagion model;single isolated network;social networks;social phenomena","","3","","33","IEEE","17 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Key players, which are typically high-degree, -k-core or -centrality agents in a networked population, are considered important for spreading social contagions. In this paper, we ask whether contagions can propagate through a population that is void of key players. We use Erdos-Renyi random graphs as a representation of unstructured populations that lack key players, and investigate whether complex contagions - those requiring reinforcement - can spread on them. We demonstrate that two game-theoretic contagion models that utilize common knowledge for collective action can readily spread such contagions, which is a significant difference from classic complex contagion models. We compare contagion dynamics results on unstructured networks to those on more typically-studied, structured social networks to understand the role of network structure. We test a total of 14 networks. The two common knowledge models are also contrasted to understand the effects of different modeling assumptions on dynamics. We show that under a wide range of conditions, these two models produce markedly different results.","","978-1-5090-6164-8","10.1109/BESC.2016.7804473","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7804473","common knowledge;collective action;key players;social modeling;complex contagion","Erbium;Sociology;Statistics;Facebook;Knowledge engineering;Context modeling","game theory;graph theory;graphs;social networking (online)","social contagion spread;social behavior;information diffusion;social influence;collective action;networked population;Erdos-Renyi random graphs;game-theoretic contagion models;complex contagion models;contagion dynamics;unstructured networks;structured social networks;network structure;modeling","","3","","22","","5 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, control strategies described by existing studies are inaccurate since few of them consider both physical and virtual cyberspace to jointly study the influence of control strategies on crowd emotional contagion.

However, the dynamics and mechanisms of these social contagions are still obscure and unrevealed because of the big data. In this paper, we propose a novel non-Markovian social contagion model to study behavior spreading under the environment of big data, in which a fraction of global individuals can transmit the behavior information to every susceptible individual, and the remaining local individuals can only transmit the behavior information to neighbors. Through extensive numerical simulations, we find that the global individuals markedly promote the behavior spreading and decrease the critical information transmission probability. In addition, we note that the degree heterogeneity of social network does not change the phenomena qualitatively. Our results may shed some lights in predicting and controlling social contagions. In further, the proposed model may be applied in real simulation platforms for emergency management in big data era.","","978-1-4673-8979-2","10.1109/IAEAC.2017.8054131","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8054131","complex networks;social contagions;behavior spreading;simulation model","Social network services;Big Data;Numerical models;Data models;Numerical simulation;Information processing;Erbium","Big Data;emergency management;social networking (online)","big data era;social medium;social media;novel nonMarkovian social contagion model;behavior information;susceptible individual;critical information transmission probability;social network;Facebook;Twitter;microblog;social contagions;emergency management","","2","","20","","2 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

First, we construct an individual emotion model and propose the personalized emotional contagion rules to consider the influences of the individual personality on crowd emotional contagion coupling the virtual and physical cyberspaces. Second, we use mean field theory to derive an evolution process and obtain mean field equations for the PVP-ECM. Then, we solve the PVP-ECM numerically using the finite difference method. Third, we construct a personalized BA scale-free network for the PVP-ECM simulation to further verify the stability of the model. Finally, we perform the PVP-ECM simulation and implement a simulation system to visualize the results of our theoretical analysis. The experimental results show that our approach can simulate the process of crowd emotional contagion more realistically.

In this paper, we investigate the robustness of common random graph models for complex networks (Erdos-Rényi, geometric random, and preferential attachment graphs). We show that the notions of connectivity and robustness coincide on these random graph models: the properties share the same threshold function in the Erdos-Rényi model, cannot be very different in the geometric random graph model, and are equivalent in the preferential attachment model.

The conventional approach is to use the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model or its derivatives. We like to note that these models are often too restrictive and may not be applicable in many realistic situations. In this paper, we propose a ‘generalized SIS model’ by allowing the existence of intermediate states between susceptible and infected states. To analyse the diffusion process of the generalized SIS model on large graphs, we use the ‘mean-field analysis technique’ to determine which initial condition leads to or prevents the outbreak of information or virus. For any general connected graphs, we show that the condition which can prevent the spread of contagions depends on two de-coupled effects: the network topology and the parametric values of the generalized SIS model. Experimental results based on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that our methodology can accurately predict the behaviour of the phase-transition process for any general graphs. We also extend our generalized SIS model to analyse the dynamics and behaviour of two competing sources. This is useful if one wants to model competing products in a large network or competition between virus and antidote in a large communication network. We present the analytical derivation and show via experiment how different factors such as initial condition, transmission rates, recovery rates or the number of states can affect the phase transition process and the final equilibrium. Our models and methodology can serve as an essential tool in analysing and understanding the information diffusion process in large networks.","2051-1329","","10.1093/comnet/cnu027","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8150044","models of complex networks;applications of complex network analysis;complex networks and epidemics;generalized SIS model;tipping point;competing sources","","","","","2","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The results show 30 different data sources for the collection of air flights and 11 additional sources for maritime and land transport. These datasets are usually complemented with other data sources, local and international, with demographic information, economic data, and statistics of traceability of the pandemic. The findings also found 15 spread models of contagion, with the SEIR model being the most widely used, followed by mathematical-based risk models.

Online data are not only helping us gain deeper insights into the structural complexity of social systems, they are also illuminating the consequences of that complexity, especially around collective and temporal dynamics.

Current algorithms lack control of key network parameters, the ability to specify to what subgraphs a node belongs to, come at a considerable complexity cost or, critically and sample from a limited ensemble of networks. To enable controlled investigations of the impact and role of subgraphs, especially for epidemics, neuronal activity or complex contagion, it is essential that the generation process be versatile and the generated networks as diverse as possible. In this article, we present two new network generation algorithms that use subgraphs as building blocks to construct networks preserving a given degree sequence. Additionally, these algorithms provide control over clustering both at node and global level. In both cases, we show that, despite being constrained by a degree sequence and global clustering, generated networks have markedly different topologies as evidenced by both subgraph prevalence and distribution around nodes, and large-scale network structure metrics such as path length and betweenness measures. Simulations of standard epidemic and complex contagion models on those networks reveal that degree distribution and global clustering do not always accurately predict the outcome of dynamical processes taking place on them. We conclude by discussing the benefits and limitations of both methods.","2051-1329","","10.1093/comnet/cnw011","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8149446","networks;clustering;subgraphs;epidemics;complex contagion","","","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We depart from this assumption and study epidemic spreading process in networks caused by agents acting as carrier of infection. These agents traverse from origins to destinations following specific paths in a network and in the process, infecting the sites they travel across. We focus our work on the Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) epidemic model and use continuous-time Markov chain analysis to model the impact of such agent mobility induced contagion mechanics by taking into account the state transitions of each node individually, as oppose to most conventional epidemic approaches which usually consider the mean aggregated behavior of all nodes. Our approach makes one mean field approximation to reduce complexity from exponential to polynomial. We study both network-wide properties such as epidemic threshold as well as individual node vulnerability under such agent assisted infection spreading process. Furthermore, we provide a first order approximation on the agents' vulnerability since infection is bi-directional. We compare our analysis of spreading process induced by agent mobility against contact-based epidemic model via a case study on London Underground network, the second busiest metro system in Europe, with real dataset recording commuters' activities in the system. We highlight the key differences in the spreading patterns between the contact-based versus agent assisted spreading models. Specifically, we show that our model predicts greater spreading radius than conventional contact-based models due to agents' movements. Another interesting finding is that, in contrast to contact-based model where nodes located more centrally in a network are proportionally more prone to infection, our model shows no such strict correlation as in our model, nodes may not be highly susceptible even located at the heart of the network and vice versa.","2327-4697","","10.1109/TNSE.2017.2764523","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)(grant numbers:I1402); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8074785","Epidemic;complex networks;carrier agent;mobility","Computer viruses;Statistics;Computational modeling;Mathematical model;Analytical models;Malware","complex networks;diseases;epidemics;graph theory;Markov processes;multi-agent systems;network theory (graphs)","agent mobility;complex networks;contact-based contagion process;Susceptible-Infected-Removed epidemic model;continuous-time Markov chain analysis;mean field approximation;contact-based epidemic model;London Underground network;epidemic spreading process;spreading process modelling;contagion mechanics","","1","","69","IEEE","19 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Simulation results predict a wide variety of possible system behavior, heavily dependent on the relative trust placed on individuals of differing social connectivity. Mass-polarization toward a positive or negative consensus occurs when a synergistic mechanism between preferential trust and polarization tendencies is sustained; a division of the population into segregated groups of different polarity is also possible under certain conditions.

The conducted analyses reveal that there is a subset of financial institutions that act as money centres. The local importance of financial institutions is moderately concentrated and assumes increased values between 2006 and 2011. Moreover, we investigate the impact that default of institutions cause on their neighbourhood and also find the most probable contagion paths within the banking system. The contagion paths change over time, but the network's central institutions remain the same. In order to assess the systemic impact of the banks' defaults, we simulate default cascades and complement the results with liquidity and solvency stress measures. We find that failure cascades hardly happen. When they do occur, the average propagation chain's length is very short. We also do not find any significant stress measure associated with banks' defaults. As a consequence, we do not find evidence of significant systemic risk associated with the BPS. Finally, we extract topological information of the network's structure by using several network measures, such as ones related to centrality and degree correlation. The extracted information is relevant for monitoring the financial stability and for understanding, in an intuitive way, many structural characteristics of the investigated network.","2051-1329","","10.1093/comnet/cnu022","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8150040","complex networks;payments system;systemic risk;contagion path","","","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Yaǧan",Carnegie Mellon University; Carnegie Mellon University,"2019 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)","27 Feb 2020","2019","","","1","6","Complex contagion models have been developed to understand a wide range of social phenomena such as adoption of cultural fads, the diffusion of belief, norms, and innovations in social networks, and the rise of collective action to join a riot. Most existing works focus on contagions where individuals' states are represented by <i>binary</i> variables, and propagation takes place over a single isolated network. However, characterization of an individual's standing on a given matter as a binary state might be overly simplistic as most of our opinions, feelings, and perceptions vary over more than two states. Also, most real-world contagions take place over multiple networks (e.g., Twitter and Facebook) or involve <i>multiplex</i> networks where individuals engage in different types of relationships (e.g., co-worker, family, etc.). To this end, this paper studies <i>multi-stage</i> complex contagions that take place over multi-layer or multiplex networks. Under a linear threshold based contagion model, we first give analytic results for the expected size of <i>global</i> cascades, i.e., cases where a randomly chosen node can initiate a propagation that eventually reaches a <i>positive</i> fraction of the whole population. Then, analytic results are confirmed by an extensive numerical study. In addition, we demonstrate how the dynamics of complex contagions is affected by the structural properties of the networks. In particular, we reveal an interesting connection between the assortativity of a network and the impact of <i>hyper-active</i> nodes on the cascade size.","2576-6813","978-1-7281-0962-6","10.1109/GLOBECOM38437.2019.9013531","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9013531","","Multiplexing;Numerical models;Facebook;Color;Computational modeling;Twitter","complex networks;network theory (graphs);social networking (online)","multiplex network;linear threshold based contagion model;multilayer network;multistage complex contagions;single isolated network;social networks;social phenomena;complex contagion models;random multiplex networks;influence propagation","","","","15","","27 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

According to past research, the difficulties of its risk assessment include complex relationship of secondary devices, and risk analysis of its impact on primary devices. Therefore, the graph theory and risk contagion model are introduced to deal with these difficulties. The secondary system risk assessment is decomposed into two parts. One is its own risk (secondary risk), another one is focused on the quantification of the corresponding primary risk (primary risk). The risk assessment model including the basic elements definition, constructing risk contagion network, and composing correlation matrix, is established. Then, a set of risk indexes for SSOS is presented according to the needs of different operation departments.

In this paper, we formalize an extension of a financial network model originally proposed by Nier et al. for scenarios such as the over-the-counter derivatives market, define a suitable global stability measure for this model, and perform a comprehensive evaluation of this stability measure over more than 700,000 combinations of networks types and parameter combinations. Based on our evaluations, we discover many interesting implications of our evaluations of this stability measure and derive topological properties and parameter combinations that may be used to flag the network as a possible fragile network.

The enhancement of non-redundant information memory also plays an important role in information spreading. In this paper, we propose a weighted two-layered social network information spreading model based on threshold model. In order to qualitatively understand the impact of weight distribution heterogeneity on information spreading, an edge-weight based compartmental theory is proposed. We find that under an arbitrary adoption threshold, reducing weight distribution heterogeneity can facilitate information spreading and promote the global adoption, yet unable to change the dependence pattern of the final adoption size on the unit transmission probability. We also find that when the initial seed fraction is less than a critical value, information cannot be transmitted explosively in the network. Increasing the fraction of initial seeds or the heterogeneity of degree distribution will alter the dependence pattern of the final adoption size on the unit transmission probability from being discontinuous to being continuous.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2948941","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61602048,61773148); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2019T120829); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2018M631073); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8879594","Complex networks;information spreading;weighted network;non-redundant information;edge-weight compartmental theory","Analytical models;Social networking (online);Numerical models;Numerical simulation;Licenses;Information processing;Cavity resonators","complex networks;network theory (graphs);probability;social networking (online);social sciences computing","social relationships;information spreading;nonredundant information memory;social network information;weight distribution heterogeneity;edge-weight based compartmental theory;two-layered weighted complex network","","4","","33","CCBY","22 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Increasing evidence has shown that financial globalization has developed into a complex nonlinear dynamical system made up of economic subsystems with extensive financial connections and linkages. The contagion effects of the spread of bonanzas in the 50 countries are identified and analyzed. The Hodrick-Prescott filter is employed to address the long-term net capital inflow trend. The comovement of financial contagion between the source country of financial turbulence and the volatility-affected country is described as a fuzzy dynamical system in which the driving and response systems are coupled. A fuzzy dynamical system scenario simulation model under a liberal economy is established by employing nonlinear differential equations to describe the contagion mechanism and the international capital flow volatility effects. The model is then extended to a dynamical system model with macroeconomic control. The coupling strength uncertainty is addressed by employing an interval type-2 fuzzy theory method. The properties of the volatility equilibrium point for the two models are discussed, and the volatility contagion principles based on locally asymptotic stability analysis are derived to explain the different volatility transmission patterns. Policy suggestions are given in three situations for providing managerial insights for policymakers and the explorations of response strategies are also presented. The global financial crisis in 2008 is used as an experimental study to demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the simulation and modeling method.","1941-0034","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2016.2574928","Research Foundation of Ministry of Education for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China(grant numbers:20130181110063); Youth Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:71501137); General Program of China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2015M572470,2015M572480); International Postdoctoral Exchange Fellowship Program of China Postdoctoral Council(grant numbers:20150028); Sichuan University(grant numbers:skzx2015-sb04,skqy201647); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7482786","Financial contagion;fuzzy dynamical systems;international capital flows;nonlinear differential equations;volatility transmission patterns","Couplings;Analytical models;Economics;Market research;Mathematical model;Uncertainty;Nonlinear dynamical systems","asymptotic stability;financial management;fuzzy set theory;globalisation;macroeconomics;nonlinear differential equations","fuzzy dynamical system;scenario simulation-based cross-border financial contagion analysis;international capital flows;emerging markets;financial globalization;complex nonlinear dynamical system;economic subsystems;Hodrick-Prescott filter;long-term net capital inflow trend;financial turbulence;volatility-affected country;nonlinear differential equations;macroeconomic control;coupling strength uncertainty;interval type-2 fuzzy theory method;volatility equilibrium point;asymptotic stability analysis;volatility transmission patterns","","8","","65","IEEE","1 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Through rigorous mathematical modelling, we have shaped the D2D data dissemination process as a social contagion dynamics of two co-evolving spreading processes. We weigh the dynamic interactions by including the concepts of homophily and awareness. We have measured the effect of homophily, awareness and network heterogeneity on information diffusion. The bio-inspired mechanism is evaluated through a rigorous mathematical and algorithm analysis, and a meaningful simulation.

We show that the phenomenon named friendship paradox makes it easier for the monophilic contagion to spread widely. We also consider the case where the underlying network stochastically evolves in response to the state of the contagion (e.g., depending on the severity of a flu virus, people restrict their interactions with others to avoid getting infected) and show that the dynamics of such a process can be approximated by a differential equation whose trajectory satisfies an algebraic constraint restricting it to a manifold. Our results shed light on how graph theoretic consequences affect contagions and, provide simple deterministic models to approximate the collective dynamics of contagions over stochastic graph processes.","2327-4697","","10.1109/TNSE.2019.2909015","Army Research Office(grant numbers:W911NF-17-1-0335); National Science Foundation(grant numbers:1714180); Air Force Office of Scientific Research(grant numbers:FA9550-18-1-0007); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8680709","Friendship paradox;diffusion;SIS model;social networks;monophily;reactive network;random graphs.","Diffusion processes;Social networking (online);Mathematical model;Adaptation models;Analytical models;Diseases;Sociology","complex networks;network theory (graphs);social network theory;stochastic processes","social networks;monophilic contagion;reactive networks;SIS diffusion processes;two-hop neighbors;friendship paradox","","6","","55","IEEE","2 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The main result is a probabilistic analysis that characterizes the cascade in an infinite network as the fixed point of a vector-valued mapping, explicit in terms of convolution integrals that can be efficiently evaluated numerically using the fast Fourier transform algorithm. A second result gives an approximate probabilistic analysis of cascades on “real world networks”, finite networks based on a fixed deterministic graph. Extensive cross testing with Monte Carlo estimates shows that this approximate analysis performs surprisingly well, and provides a flexible “microscope” that can be used to investigate properties of information cascades in real world networks over a wide range of model parameters.","2051-1329","","10.1093/comnet/cnt003","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8227065","contagion;random graph;stochastic network;information cascade;cascade condition;bond percolation;systemic risk;banking network","","","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

To address these questions, we developed a nonexperimental, noninvasive method to detect and quantify contagion of semantic expression in massive online social networks, which we review and discuss here. Using only observational data, the method avoids performing emotional experiments on users of online social networks, a research practice that recently became an object of criticism and concern. Our model combines geographic aggregation and instrumental variables regression to measure the effect of an exogenous variable on an individual's expression and the influence of this change on the expression of others to whom that individual is socially connected. In a previous work, we applied our method to the emotional content of posts generated by a large sample of users over a period of three years. Those results suggest that each post expressing a positive or negative emotion can cause friends to generate one to two additional posts expressing the same emotion, and it also inhibits their use of the opposite emotion. Here, we generalize our method so it can be applied to contexts different than emotional expression and to different forms of content generated by the users of online platforms. The method allows us to determine the usage of words in the same semantic category spread, and to estimate a signed relationship between different semantic categories, showing that an increase in the usage of one category alters the usage of another category in one's social contacts. Finally, it also allows us to estimate the total cumulative effect that a person has on all of her social contacts.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2014.2366052","Army Research Office (ARO)(grant numbers:W911NF-11-1-0363); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6955798","Influence;instrumental variables;nonexperimental methods;semantic expression;social networks;Influence;instrumental variables;nonexperimental methods;semantic expression;social networks","Semantics;Social network services;Urban areas;Context modeling;Internet;Mathematical model;Complex networks","human factors;psychology;regression analysis;social networking (online)","noninvasive detection method;emotional contagion;online social networks;semantic expression;geographic aggregation;instrumental variable regression;social contacts","","11","","58","IEEE","13 Nov 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper describes the Effective Contagion Matrix (ECM), a solution to address recency bias in the analysis of dynamic complex networks. The idea of ECM is to explicitly consider the temporal order of links and chains of links connecting to a node with some temporal decay factors. We tested ECM with three large real world citation networks on the task of predicting papers' future importance. We compared ECM's performance with two static metrics, degree-centrality and Page Rank, and two time-aware metrics, age-based Page Rank and Cite Rank. We show that ECM is more appropriate for predicting future citations and Page Rank scores with regard to new citations. We also describe a procedure to estimate ECM's parameters from the data. Combining all five scores into a v-SVR regression model of future citations improves the predictive performance further.","2375-9259","978-1-4673-0005-6","10.1109/ICDMW.2011.183","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6137404","data mining;network analysis;dynamic networks;citation networks","Measurement;Electronic countermeasures;Random access memory;Correlation;Web pages;Heuristic algorithms;Complex networks","citation analysis;complex networks;network theory (graphs);regression analysis;support vector machines","time aware ranking;dynamic citation networks;centrality metrics;PageRank;effective contagion matrix;dynamic complex networks;temporal decay factors;time aware metrics;CiteRank;v-SVR regression model","","22","","18","","23 Jan 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Asymptotic stability analysis of the all-adopt as well as the none-adopt equilibria of the combined opinion-adoption model is provided through the use of Lyapunov arguments. In doing so, sufficient conditions are provided which determine the stability of the “flop” state, where no one adopts the product and everyone's opinion of the product is least favorable, and the “hit” state, where everyone adopts and their opinions are most favorable. These conditions are shown to extend to the bounded confidence opinion dynamic under a stronger assumption on the model parameters. Additional analysis is provided for the case where the product is neither a hit nor a flop.

A protection buyer bank transfers the risk of every possible debtor bank default to protection seller banks. The empirical distribution of the number of bank bankruptcies is obtained with the extended model. Systemic capital buffer ratio is calculated from the distribution. The ratio quantifies the effective loss absorbency capability of the entire financial system to force back financial contagion. The key finding is that the leverage ratio is a good estimate of a systemic capital buffer ratio as the backstop of a financial system.

Viruses are exhaled by infected people into respiratory particles with sizes less than 50 microns (microdroplets) that are suspended in the air (aerosols) and can be transported to distances greater than 2 meters within a closed room, such as classrooms. Therefore, in closed school environments, the conditions of occupation and ventilation are essential to determine and minimize the risk of transmission of the virus. There are various techniques to physically assess the air change rate (ACH) in an indoor space or to estimate it indirectly by measuring carbon dioxide (CO<inf>2</inf>). However, these procedures could be complex for an untrained community or in the absence of a CO<inf>2</inf> monitor. The application of mathematical models allows alternatively to evaluate the ventilation conditions from the estimation of ACH or the concentration of CO<inf>2</inf> in an intramural space. Some mathematical models were included as part of a guide developed for the evaluation and monitoring of ventilation in school settings. In this work, the application of mass balance models is presented, under conditions of complete mixing, in a classroom in order to estimate ACH from the volume and occupation of the room. Likewise, mathematical expressions are developed to estimate the concentration of CO<inf>2</inf> and evaluate the risk of contagion to COVID-19 in situations with and without ventilation.

Epidemic models for large populations and finite populations on networks have been used to understand and control both transient and steady-state behaviors. Typically it is assumed that after recovery from an infection, every agent will either return to its original susceptible state or acquire full immunity to reinfection. We study the network SIRI (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Infected) model, an epidemic model for the spread of contagious processes on a network of heterogeneous agents that can adapt their susceptibility to reinfection. The model generalizes existing models to accommodate realistic conditions in which agents acquire partial or compromised immunity after first exposure to an infection. We prove necessary and sufficient conditions on model parameters and network structure that distinguish four dynamic regimes: infection-free, epidemic, endemic, and bistable. For the bistable regime, which is not accounted for in traditional models, we show how there can be a rapid resurgent epidemic after what looks like convergence to an infection-free population. We use the model and its predictive capability to show how control strategies can be designed to mitigate problematic contagious behaviors.","1558-2523","","10.1109/TAC.2020.2985300","Army Research Office(grant numbers:W911NF-18-1-0325); Office of Naval Research(grant numbers:N00014-19-1-2556); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9057446","Adaptive systems, complex networks;multiagent systems;propagation of infection;spreading dynamics","Adaptation models;Sociology;Statistics;Steady-state;Analytical models;Adaptive systems;Computational modeling","artificial immune systems;convergence;directed graphs;epidemics;multi-agent systems;network theory (graphs);stability","adaptive susceptibility;contagion models;contagious processes;infectious diseases;social behaviors;computer viruses;biological systems;social systems;technological systems;epidemic model;finite populations;steady-state behavior;susceptible state;heterogeneous agents;partial immunity;compromised immunity;network structure;infection-free population;problematic contagious behaviors;stability analysis;strongly connected digraphs;rapid resurgent epidemic;sufficient conditions;necessary conditions;transient behavior;reinfection susceptibility;network SIRI model;susceptible-infected-recovered-infected model","","4","","49","IEEE","6 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In actual-world societies,the balance between personal and social interests is self-regulated through social conventions that emerge in a decentralized manner. As such, a computational mechanism that allows to engineer the emergence of social conventions in MAS can become a highly promising tool to endow open MAS with self-regulating capabilities. To this end we propose a computational self-adapting mechanism that facilitates agents to distributively evolve their social behavior to reach the best social conventions. Our approach borrows from the social contagion phenomenon: social conventions are akin to infectious diseases that spread themselves through members of the society. Furthermore, we experimentally show that our mechanism helps a MAS to regulate itself by searching and establishing (better) social conventions on a wide range of interaction topologies and dynamic environments.","1949-3681","978-0-7695-3404-6","10.1109/SASO.2008.65","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4663420","emergence;conventions;self-adaptation;MAS;distributed intelligence","Complex networks;Diseases;Technological innovation;Network topology;Autonomous agents;Multiagent systems;Artificial intelligence;Councils;Distributed computing;Computer viruses","distributed processing;multi-agent systems","infection-based mechanism;multiagent complex networks;distributed mechanisms;multiagent systems;social conventions;interaction topologies","","7","","20","","31 Oct 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This strongly associates the epidemic spreading process with node degrees. The role of the infection transmission medium is often neglected. In real-world networks, however, the infectious agent as the physical contagion medium usually flows from one node to another via specific directed routes (path-based infection). Here, we use continuous-time Markov chain analysis to model the influence of the infectious agent and routing paths on the spreading behavior by taking into account the state transitions of each node individually, rather than the mean aggregated behavior of all nodes. By applying a mean field approximation, the analysis complexity of the path-based infection mechanics is reduced from exponential to polynomial. We show that the structure of the topology plays a secondary role in determining the size of the epidemic. Instead, it is the routing algorithm and traffic intensity that determine the survivability and the steady-state of the epidemic. We define an infection characterization matrix that encodes both the routing and the traffic information. Based on this, we derive the critical path-based epidemic threshold below which the epidemic will die off, as well as conditional bounds of this threshold which network operators may use to promote/suppress path-based spreading in their networks. Finally, besides artificially generated random and scale-free graphs, we also use real-world networks and traffic, as case studies, in order to compare the behaviors of contact- and path-based epidemics.

However, the so-termed adoption times when blogs mention popular news items, individuals in a community catch an infectious disease, or consumers adopt a trendy electronics product are typically known, and are implicitly dependent on the underlying network. To infer the network topology, a dynamic structural equation model is adopted to capture the relationship between observed adoption times and the unknown edge weights. Assuming a slowly time-varying topology and leveraging the sparse connectivity inherent to social networks, edge weights are estimated by minimizing a sparsity-regularized exponentially-weighted least-squares criterion. To this end, solvers with complementary strengths are developed by leveraging (pseudo) real-time sparsity-promoting proximal gradient iterations, the improved convergence rate of accelerated variants, or reduced computational complexity of stochastic gradient descent. Numerical tests with both synthetic and real data demonstrate the effectiveness of the novel algorithms in unveiling sparse dynamically-evolving topologies, while accounting for external influences in the adoption times.

This article proposes a fine-grain modeling methodology for NPIs, based on high-order relationships between people and environments, mimicking direct and indirect contagion pathways over time. After assessing the ability of each intervention in controlling an epidemic propagation, we devise a multi-objective optimization framework, which, based on the epidemiological data, calculates the NPI combination that should be implemented to minimize the spread of an epidemic as well as the damage due to the intervention. Each intervention is thus evaluated through an agent-based simulation, considering not only the reduction in the fraction of infected but also to what extent its application damages the daily life of the population. We run experiments on three data sets, and the results illustrate how the application of NPIs should be tailored to the specific epidemic situation. They further highlight the critical importance of correctly implementing personal protective (e.g., using face masks) and sanitization measures to slow down a pathogen spreading, especially in crowded places.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3119459","European Union Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme(grant numbers:769872 (EMPATHIC),823907 (MENHIR)); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9567682","Agent-based modeling;complex networks;epidemic;high-order relationships;hypergraphs;non-pharmaceutical interventions","Mathematical models;Biological system modeling;Statistics;Sociology;Context modeling;Social networking (online);Pandemics","data analysis;drugs;epidemics;graph theory;medical computing;modelling;optimisation","hyper-graphs;pathogen spreading;data sets;epidemic control strategies;agent-based simulation;epidemiological data;multiobjective optimization framework;epidemic propagation;indirect contagion pathways;direct contagion pathways;high-order relationships;fine-grain modeling methodology;closely tied aspects;numerous tied aspects;drug treatments;severe outbreak;NPIs;nonpharmaceutical interventions;high-order temporal networks;sanitization measures;specific epidemic situation","","1","","73","CCBY","11 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Specific strategies can cause artifacts - i.e. outcomes of a simulation not due to any intrinsic properties of the model itself but caused directly by the updating strategy. To guard against artifacts multiple strategies should be used on a model and the outcomes compared. Currently, while both Synchronous and asynchronous updating are used in CA based simulations, AU is used almost exclusively in ABM.

However, in many spreading processes individuals may acquire only partial immunity to the infection or may become more susceptible to reinfection after recovery. We study a model for reinfection called Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Infected (SIRI). The SIRI model generalizes the SIS and SIR models and allows for study of systems in which the susceptibility of agents changes irreversibly after first exposure to the infection. We show that when the rate of reinfection is higher than the rate of primary infection, the SIRI model exhibits bistability with a small difference in the initial fraction of infected individuals determining whether the infection dies out or spreads through the population. We find this critical value and show that when the infection does not die out there is a resurgent epidemic in which the number of infected individuals decays initially and remains at a low level for an arbitrarily long period of time before rapidly increasing toward an endemic equilibrium in which the fraction of infected individuals is non-zero.","2475-1456","","10.1109/LCSYS.2018.2832063","ONR(grant numbers:N00014-14-1-0635); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8353159","Nonlinear systems;contagion dynamics;compartmental systems","Silicon;Sociology;Statistics;Immune system;Analytical models;Steady-state;Biological system modeling","complex networks;diseases;epidemics","immunity;susceptibility;primary infection;reinfection models;bistability;resurgent epidemics;susceptible-infected-recovered-infected ]model;SIRI model","","7","","17","IEEE","1 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Majority rule (MR) is improved by taking into account the existence of a threshold of opinion transition of individuals, which characterizes the human nature of sticking to one's own opinion to a certain extent, so as to remedy the defect of the Lambiotte model's assumption that individuals preferentially follow the crowed in their opinion update (e.g. herding behaviours in public choices). A phase diagram about the opinion evolution in the two groups is obtained where there are three regimes, and the self-organization phenomena and its features are discovered in regime 2. While the emergence of a dominate opinion may take place in this regime without managers' intervention, it is clear that the dominate opinion is unpredictable.

Existing literature mainly focus on investigating how network structure affects the contagion of health sentiments. However, most of these studies neglect that the interaction topology change in time. In fact, the change of inter-individual connections over time is associated with individual attributes. The mechanism through which individual attributes reshapes the connection topology is mainly governed by the competition between two principles, i.e., homophily (establishing or reinforcing social connections) and homeostasis (preserving the total strength of social connections to each individual). No existing approaches are yet able to accommodate these two competing effects at the same time. We thus propose a new statistical model (H2 model, Homophily and Homestasis model) to depict the evolution of temporal network, which is governed by the competition of homophily and homeostasis. In addition, we consider the mediation effect of external shock events, which enables us to separate exogenous confounding factors. Evaluation on Twitter data suggests that H2 model can capture long-range sentiment dynamics and external shock events. In sentiment prediction, H2 consistently outperforms existing methods in terms of error rate. Through the model's shock tensor, we successfully detect several typical events, and reveal that users in negative emotions are more influenced by external shock events than those with positive emotions. Our findings have practical significance for those who supervise and guide health sentiments in online communities.","","978-1-5090-6727-5","10.1109/ISI.2017.8004882","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8004882","health sentiment;competitive interactions;homophily;homeostasis;social media","Electric shock;Social network services;Topology;Network topology;Tensile stress;Diffusion processes;Mathematical model","health care;medical computing;social networking (online)","health sentiment dynamics;competitive interactions;social media;public sentiments;network structure;health sentiments;interaction topology;connection topology;reinforcing social connections;statistical model;homestasis model;homophily model;temporal network;confounding factors;Twitter data;external shock events;long-range sentiment dynamics;online communities","","","","24","","10 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Global behaviors generally emerge from the interplay between the structure of the interconnection topology and the local agents' interactions. We focus on the Threshold Model (TM) of cascades first introduced by Granovetter (1978). This can be interpreted as the best response dynamics in a network game whereby agents choose strategically between two actions. Each agent is equipped with an individual threshold representing the number of her neighbors who must have adopted a certain action for that to become the agent's best response. We analyze the TM dynamics on large-scale networks with heterogeneous agents. Through a local mean-field approach, we obtain a nonlinear, one-dimensional, recursive equation that approximates the evolution of the TM dynamics on most of the networks of a given size and distribution of degrees and thresholds. We prove that, on all but a fraction of networks with given degree and threshold statistics that is vanishing as the network size grows large, the actual fraction of adopters of a given action is arbitrarily close to the output of the aforementioned recursion. Numerical simulations on some real network testbeds show good adherence to the theoretical predictions.","2327-4697","","10.1109/TNSE.2017.2777941","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8120135","Cascades;social networks;threshold model;coordination game;best response;random graphs;local mean-field","Sociology;Statistics;Biological system modeling;Network topology;Games;Mathematical model;Numerical simulation","complex networks;financial management;game theory;graph theory;multi-agent systems;network theory (graphs);nonlinear equations;numerical analysis;statistical analysis","threshold statistics;network size;network testbeds;large-scale networks;social networks;economic networks;cascading mechanisms;contagion dynamics;financial networks;global behaviors;interconnection topology;response dynamics;network game;TM dynamics;heterogeneous agents;local agent interactions;threshold model;local mean-field approach;nonlinear one-dimensional recursive equation;numerical simulations","","10","","34","IEEE","27 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In such coupled systems, individual vaccinating behavior usually depends on the perceived rather than real payoffs of infection and vaccination, which has not been fully explored. In this paper, we study the dynamics of disease-behavior systems and associated economic costs under perceived payoffs. We consider two factors affecting such perceived payoffs: the population structure on which information and diseases spread, and individuals' capabilities of processing information. They are modeled by network and prospect theory, respectively. Specifically, the population structure is described by a two-layer network composed of the decision-making network and the infection contagion network. We find network characteristics, such as network diameter, degree heterogeneity, and clustering, do not influence disease-behavior systems. On the other hand, taking local information from neighbors into account during the decision-making process and increasing the availability of vaccination raise the equilibrium level of vaccination. In addition, lowering the average degree of the infection contagion network (i.e., reducing physical contacts in the target population) suppresses the spread of diseases. All the three interventions reduce the costs of populations.","1948-9447","978-1-7281-0106-4","10.1109/CCDC.2019.8832524","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8832524","Dynamical Systems;Feedback;Epidemiology;Complex Networks;Evolutionary Game Theory","Sociology;Statistics;Decision making;Vaccines;Economics;Infectious diseases","decision making;diseases;epidemics;graph theory;network theory (graphs);optimisation","disease prevalence;perceived payoffs;decision-making network;infection contagion network;disease outbreaks;disease-behavior systems;vaccinating behavior;payoff-maximizers;feedback loop;two-layer network;dynamic analysis;population structure","","","","20","","12 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The characterization relies on basic methods in homological algebra, and is reminiscent of the rank-nullity theorem of linear algebra. Interconnection of systems is first expressed as an exact sequence, then loss of memory causes a loss of exactness, and finally exactness is recovered through specific algebraic invariants of the systems that encode the role of memory.

This paper suggests a more nuanced view of the effect of interconnectivity and resource sharing since interconnectivity may contribute to system fragility, which is associated with a possibility of abrupt/discontinuous system transition to a persistent overloaded regime with unacceptably high delays. This possibility is a result of the same system interconnectivity, which enables not only desirable but also undesirable load transfer throughout the networked system. Our results indicate that benefits of dynamic queuing disciplines, including low latency, can be realized provided that the relevant systemic risks of undesirable contagion are eliminated or mitigated. Due to the intractability of conventional performance models of large-scale interconnected systems, we use the “Complex Systems” methodology, e.g., a mean-field approximate performance model.","","978-3-901882-94-4","10.23919/IFIPNetworking.2017.8264884","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8264884","cloud computing model;dynamic queuing;low latency;fragility","Servers;Resource management;Dynamic scheduling;Computational modeling;Economics;Cloud computing;Routing","cloud computing;computer network reliability;large-scale systems;queueing theory","fragility risks;low latency dynamic queuing;large-scale clouds;Complex system perspective;cloud computing model;dynamic resource sharing;undesirable load transfer","","","","12","","22 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A variety of methods have been proposed and implemented on market contagion. However, most of the existing literature simply test the existence of market contagion in financial crisis, and there is limited work go deep to investigate the complex market couplings which are the essence of market contagion. This is indeed very difficult as it involves the selection of discriminative indicators, the different types of couplings (intra-market coupling, inter-market coupling), the hidden characteristic of couplings, and the evaluation of market couplings in understanding crisis. To address these issues, this paper proposes a CHMM-LR framework to investigate the relations between financial crisis and three pairwise market couplings from three typical global financial markets: Equity market, Commodity market and Interest market. We adopt Coupled Hidden Markov Model (CHMM) to capture the complex hidden pairwise market couplings, and the financial crisis forecasting abilities based on different pairwise market couplings are imported to measure the relations by Logistic Regression (LR). Experiments of real financial data during the period 1990 to 2010 show the advantages of market couplings in understanding crisis. In addition, the experimental results provide crucial interpretation for the 2008 global financial crisis periods identification.","","978-1-4673-8272-4","10.1109/DSAA.2015.7344854","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7344854","","Couplings;Hidden Markov models;Forecasting;Training;Globalization;Indexes;Predictive models","financial data processing;globalisation;hidden Markov models;logistics data processing;regression analysis;stock markets","global market couplings;global financial crisis;global financial markets;market contagion;CHMM-LR framework;coupled hidden Markov model;logistic regression;financial data","","","","22","","7 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a result, simple models of topological contagion do not accurately represent the propagation of cascades in power systems. However, cascading power outages do follow patterns, some of which are useful in understanding and reducing blackout risk. This paper describes a method by which the data from many cascading failure simulations can be transformed into a graph-based model of influences that provides actionable information about the many ways that cascades propagate in a particular system. The resulting “influence graph” model is Markovian, in that component outage probabilities depend only on the outages that occurred in the prior generation. To validate the model, we compare the distribution of cascade sizes resulting from n-2 contingencies in a 2896 branch test case to cascade sizes in the influence graph. The two distributions are remarkably similar. In addition, we derive an equation with which one can quickly identify modifications to the proposed system that will substantially reduce cascade propagation. With this equation, one can quickly identify critical components that can be improved to substantially reduce the risk of large cascading blackouts.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2016.2578259","National Science Foundation (NSF)(grant numbers:ECCS-1254549,DGE-1144388); US DTRA(grant numbers:HDTRA110-1-0088); NSF(grant numbers:CPS-1135825); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7501508","Big data;cascading failure;complex networks","Power system faults;Data models;Power system protection;Mathematical model;Power grids;Stress","graph theory;Markov processes;power transmission reliability;probability","cascading power transmission outage;influence graph model;nonlocal propagation;blackout risk understanding;blackout risk reduction;cascading failure simulations;Markovian model;component outage probabilities","","70","","38","OAPA","28 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An important aspect of individual behaviour is emotion which plays a significant role in all aspects of human decision making. For example, heightened emotional states can lead people to take highly unexpected or irrational actions. One popular motivation for simulation of virtual crowds is to generate believable characters in movies and computer games. Recently the concept of serious games has been introduced in both academic and industrial circles. In this paper, we propose an emotion engine, based on modern appraisal theory, that is able to model various emotional crowd characteristics. This appraisal engine is capable of capturing the dynamics of emotional contagion and we show how different crowd composition can lead to different patterns of emotional contagion. In addition, we describe a serious game designed for training military personnel in peaceful crowd control. We evaluate this engine in the context of a property protection protest scenario where the players or soldiers are tasked to maintain a peaceful protest without violence. A systematic evaluation is presented which supports the facial validity of the emotion engine and our model of emotional contagion.","","978-1-4577-1373-6","10.1109/WI-IAT.2011.154","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6040757","Emotion Modelling;Crowd Simulation;Serious Games","Appraisal;Engines;Games;Computational modeling;Humans;Pattern matching;Context","computer based training;computer games;decision making;military computing;multi-agent systems;virtual reality","computational model;agent-based crowds;serious games;crowd behaviour;human decision making;virtual crowd simulation;computer games;emotion engine;appraisal theory;emotional crowd characteristics;appraisal engine;emotional contagion;military personnel training;property protection protest scenario;soldiers","","14","","16","","10 Oct 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Examples include the rise of collective action to join a riot and diffusion of beliefs, norms, and cultural fads, to name a few. Most existing works on modeling influence propagation consider a single content (e.g., an opinion, decision, product, political view, etc.) spreading over a network independent from everything else. However, most real-life examples involve multiple correlated contents spreading simultaneously and exhibiting positive (e.g., opinions on same-sex marriage and gun control) or negative (e.g., opinions on universal health care and tax-relief for the “rich”) correlation. To accommodate these cases, this paper proposes the vector threshold model, as an extension of the widely used Watts threshold model for complex contagions. Here, the state of a node is represented by a binary vector representing their opinion on a number of content items. Nodes switch their states based on the influence they receive from their neighbors in the network. The influence is represented by a vector containing the proportion of neighbors who support each content; both positively and negatively correlated contents can be captured in this formulation by using different rules for switching node states. Our main result is concerned with the expected size of global cascades, i.e., cases where a randomly chosen node can initiate a propagation that eventually reaches a positive fraction of the whole population. We also derive conditions on network structure for global cascades to be possible. Analytic results are supported by a numerical study.","1938-1883","978-1-5386-8088-9","10.1109/ICC.2019.8761313","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8761313","","Correlation;Numerical models;Medical services;Analytical models;Switches;Sociology","complex networks;network theory (graphs);social sciences;vectors","vector threshold model;simultaneous spread;correlated influence;collective action;influence propagation;network independent;multiple correlated contents;universal health care;binary vector;content items;negatively correlated contents;propagation process;Watts threshold model","","","","22","","15 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In game-theoretic contexts, successful coordination requires that people know each others' willingness to participate, and that this information is common knowledge among a sufficient number of people. We develop an agent-based model of collective action that was the first to combine social structure and individual incentives. Another novel aspect of the model is that a social network increases in density (i.e., new graph edges are formed) over time. The model studies the formation of common knowledge through local interactions and the characterizing social network structures.

We study the effect of both smooth dependancies and discontinuities of the contact rate. In the first case, we prove the existence of a threshold phenomenon that generalizes the well-known dichotomy associated to the reproduction rate parameter in the classical SIR model.

We study the information flow networks of the Chinese stock market and identify important sectors and information flow paths. This paper uses the daily closing price data of the 28 level-1 sectors from Shenyin & Wanguo Securities ranging from 2000 to 2017 to study the information transmission between different sectors. We construct information flow networks with the sectors as the nodes and the transfer entropy between them as the corresponding edges. Then we adopt the maximum spanning arborescence (MSA) to extract important information flows and the hierarchical structure of the networks. We find that, during the whole sample period, the composite sector is an information source of the whole stock market, while the non-bank financial sector is the information sink. We also find that the non-bank finance, bank, computer, media, real estate, medical biology and non-ferrous metals sectors appear as high-degree root nodes in the outgoing and incoming information flow MSAs. Especially, the non-bank finance and bank sectors have significantly high degrees after 2008 in the outgoing information flow networks. We uncover how stock market turmoils affect the structure of the MSAs. Finally, we reveal the specificity of information source and sink sectors and make a conclusion that the root node sector acts as the information sink of the incoming information flow networks. Overall, our analyses show that the structure of information flow networks changes with time and the market exhibits a sector rotation phenomenon.

We study the coupled system created by coupling the UIUC 150 Bus System with synthesized scale-free cyber network. Simulation results present that the dynamic profile of the cascading failures in a coupled system displays a “staircase-like” pattern which can be interpreted as a combined feature of the typical step propagation profile triggered repeatedly by cyber attacks due to cyber network coupling. Results also show that cyber coupling can intensify both the extent and rapidity of power blackouts.

Based on local properties of the individual agents and their connections, groups and dynamic properties of these groups are identified. To determine such dynamic group properties two abstraction methods are proposed: determining a group invariant and approximation of group processes by weighted averaging of interactions. This enables simulation of the multi-agent system at a more abstract level by considering groups as single entities substituting a large number of interacting agents. In this way the scalability of large-scale simulation can be improved significantly. Computational properties of the developed approach are addressed in the paper. The approach is illustrated for a collective decision making model.","","978-1-4577-1931-8","10.1109/PASSAT/SocialCom.2011.140","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6113225","social contagion;group abstraction;agent-based simulation;large-scale multi-agent systems","Computational modeling;Equations;Decision making;Mathematical model;Multiagent systems;Approximation methods;Differential equations","decision making;multi-agent systems","group abstraction;large-scale agent-based social diffusion models;large-scale multiagents systems;dynamic group properties;group invariant determination;group process approximation;interacting agents;large-scale simulation;collective decision making model","","6","","12","","2 Jan 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A large number of current approaches that address this problem focus on classifying emotion expressions by grouping them into known categories. Such strategies neglect, among other aspects, the impact of the affective responses from an individual on their interaction partner thus ignoring how people empathize towards each other. This is also reflected in the datasets used to train models for affective processing tasks. Most of the recent datasets, in particular, the ones which capture natural interactions (“in-the-wild” datasets), are designed, collected, and annotated based on the recognition of displayed affective reactions, ignoring how these displayed or expressed emotions are perceived. In this paper, we propose a novel dataset composed of dyadic interactions designed, collected and annotated with a focus on measuring the affective impact that eight different stories have on the listener. Each video of the dataset contains around 5 minutes of interaction where a speaker tells a story to a listener. After each interaction, the listener annotated, using a valence scale, how the story impacted their affective state, reflecting how they empathized with the speaker as well as the story. We also propose different evaluation protocols and a baseline that encourages participation in the advancement of the field of artificial empathy and emotion contagion.","2156-8111","978-1-7281-3888-6","10.1109/ACII.2019.8925530","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8925530","Empathy;Dyadic Interactions;Affective Behaviour","Emotion recognition;Computational modeling;Human computer interaction;Multimedia computing;Intelligent agents","emotion recognition;human computer interaction;multimedia computing","displayed affective reactions;dyadic interactions;emotion contagion;OMG-empathy dataset;human affective behavior;intelligent agents;emotion expressions;storytelling","","2","","37","","9 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We define a trigger-conditional multivariate Hawkes process, where excitation is conditional on the presence of active triggers. An arrival in this process corresponds to a batch of protestors, and random marks on the arrival serve to capture both the excitation-related parameters as well as the size of protest. The batch arrival intensity and the batch size, while mutually independent, exhibit respective history-dependence due to memory that is modeled in the excitation phenomena.

One task of particular interest is entity resolution in familial networks. In this setting, multiple partial representations of a family tree are provided, from the perspective of different family members, and the challenge is to reconstruct a family tree from these multiple, noisy, partial views. This reconstruction is crucial for applications such as understanding genetic inheritance, tracking disease contagion, and performing census surveys. Here, we design a model that incorporates statistical signals, such as name similarity, relational information, such as sibling overlap, and logical constraints, such as transitivity and bijective matching, in a collective model. We show how to integrate these features using probabilistic soft logic, a scalable probabilistic programming framework.

This far, financial crisis is detected through the macro approach. This study seek for another point of view. We predict the financial crisis through the micro view, where focuses on detailed network components called motif. Network motifs are used as a tool to predict financial crisis by focusing on the microscopic structure change within a network. The network structure changes due to a disruption. We explore the network motifs change under pre-crisis, crisis, and post-crisis periods (October 2007 to March 2009). We use the network structural change response to determine predictor(s). The motif types that having major changes along the crisis period then determined as crisis predictor. Through the scenario, we discover one motif as the underlying predictor of financial crisis. This study is able to support the financial system stability supervision.","","978-1-7281-5347-6","10.1109/IWBIS.2019.8935758","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8935758","network motifs;triadic motifs;banking transaction;banking transaction network","Banking;Economics;Microscopy;Business;Social networking (online);DNA;Tools","banking;financial management;network theory (graphs);stock markets","pre-crisis period;financial crisis;financial system stability supervision;motif exploration;dynamic banking transaction network;financial architecture backbone;interbank transactions;network motifs;microscopic structure change;post-crisis periods;network structural change response;interconnected transactions","","1","","16","","19 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We first propose methods for analyzing historical data to quantify the infection probability of a node with a given set of properties in a given time and assess the potential of a given seeding strategy to infect nodes. Then, we examine the potential of a scheduled seeding strategy by analyzing a real-world large-scale dataset containing both the network topology as well as the nodes’ infection times. Specifically, we use the proposed methods to demonstrate the existence of two important effects in our dataset: a complex contagion effect and a diminishing social influence effect. As shown in a recent study, the scheduled seeding approach is expected to benefit greatly from the existence of these two effects. Finally, we compare a number of benchmark seeding strategies to a scheduled seeding strategy that ranks nodes based on a combination of the number of infectious friends (NIF) they have, as well as the time that has passed since they became infectious. Results of our analyses show that for a seeding budget of 1%, the scheduled seeding strategy yields a convergence rate that is 14% better than a seeding strategy based solely on their degrees, and 215% better than a random seeding strategy, which is often used in practice.","2329-924X","","10.1109/TCSS.2021.3109043","Kamin Grant of the Israeli Chief Scientist(grant numbers:58073); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9534701","Influence maximization;scheduled seeding;social network analysis","Social networking (online);Mathematical model;Statistics;Sociology;Analytical models;Approximation algorithms;Greedy algorithms","graph theory;network theory (graphs);optimisation;probability;social networking (online)","real-world setting;given seeding strategy;scheduled seeding strategy;nodes;diminishing social influence effect;scheduled seeding approach;benchmark seeding strategies;seeding budget;random seeding strategy;influence maximization","","1","","49","IEEE","9 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, quantifying social influence is a difficult task, even in online social systems where the interactions and communication content can be closely followed. Here we study the information susceptibility and adoption thresholds of users on Twitter. We consider hashtag and retweet adoptions on different aggregation levels: items, users, and topic groups, and study these adoption mechanisms characterized by diversified or repeated influence stimuli. We find both metrics to be heterogeneously distributed, correlated, and dependent on the topics and aggregation level of social influence. We show that users adopt retweets easier than hashtags, and find that new influencing neighbors can effectively trigger adoptions. Our results may inform better models of adoption processes leading to a deeper empirical understanding of simple and complex contagion.","2473-991X","978-1-7281-1056-1","10.1109/ASONAM49781.2020.9381365","CAPES(grant numbers:PPM-00253-18); ANR(grant numbers:ANR-19-CE46-0008,ANR-15-CE38-0011,H2020-871042); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9381365","Social Influence;Susceptibility;Adoption Threshold","Measurement;Correlation;Social networking (online);Blogs;Predictive models;Lead;Task analysis","social networking (online)","social ties;share information;social influence;online social systems;information susceptibility;adoption thresholds;Twitter;topic groups;adoption mechanisms;diversified repeated influence stimuli;aggregation level;influencing neighbors;information adoption;diversified social influence","","1","","27","","24 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"The Impact of Peer Pressure: Extending Axelrod's Model on Cultural Polarisation","R. Morris; L. Turner; R. Whitaker; C.

Although it has been studied in the context of humans, it is also relevant to future intelligent cognitive systems, that could have the capability to update their disposition and strategy based on the influence of others. In this work we transfer concepts from social sciences to the computing sciences and examine the effect of peer influence on culture. We consider the notion of ""peer pressure"", being the combined effect from all an individual's neighbours exerting influence at the same time, and also through influence flowing from indirect sources. This approach is derived using Social Impact Theory. We benchmark this against the cultural polarisation model from Axelrod, which involves influence being restricted to dyadic interactions between agents. We find that peer pressure provides complex contagion with a significant impact on cultural evolution. Greater cultural diversity is maintained, with indirect paths mitigating this by effectively forming disruptive weak links. This reaffirms that maintaining diversity in social ties, as well as a wide breadth, supports the mitigation of cultural isolation and polarisation. The model provides a platform to explore culture in a wide range of further scenarios, including electronic, coalition and organisational contexts.","","978-1-7281-2711-8","10.1109/ICCC.2019.00030","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8816877","Computational Modelling;Cultural polarisation;Agent-based Modelling;Homophily","Cultural differences;Computational modeling;Social networking (online);Measurement;Peer-to-peer computing;Lattices;Cognitive systems","cognitive systems;cultural aspects;multi-agent systems;social sciences computing","peer influence;peer pressure;cultural polarisation model;dyadic interactions;cultural evolution;social ties;cultural isolation;social impact theory;cultural diversity;Axelrod model;intelligent cognitive systems;agent-based modelling","","1","","37","","29 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Analysis on spatial pattern change of land use types and its influences on ecosystem services value: a case study of Wuchuan County in China","Zhigang Xu; Dafang Zhuang","Institute of Geographical Sciences and Natural Resources, Research, Graduate University of CAS.

The study area was Wuchuan County in Inner Mongolia Municipality. Based on land use type maps of 1980s, 1995 and 2000, changes of land use types and transition matrix were firstly obtained. Then landscape pattern indices were developed by Fragstats. Next, ecosystem service values of the three phases were calculated through ecosystem service value formula by constanza and China ecosystem service value indices by Xie Gaodi. At last, analysis on the relationship between changes of land use types and ecosystem service values were done. The results consisted of three points: (a) from 1980s to 2000, spatial pattern of land use types had changed a lot, and the annual change rate was high. In 1980s, grassland was the dominant land use type, while cropland and grassland became main land use types in 2000. Woodland decreased firstly and then increased, which was the result of the government policy. From the land use transition matrix, we concluded that the increase of cropland came mainly from grassland, and the change of woodland was the result of interconversion between woodland and grassland. Urban and rural areas increased slowly, which indicated the speed of urbanization process was slow. (b) Calculation results of seven landscape pattern indices indicated that the study area had a middle level of landscape fragmentation. From 1980s to 2000, the fragmentation level of study area increased firstly and then decreased and generally increased. Dominance and contagion index decreased. Landscape shape became more complex and the quality of ecosystem dropped, which was an outcome of human activities. (c) Cropland, woodland and grassland provided the main ecosystem services in the study area. The main ecosystem services were soil formation and protection, waste treatment, water regulation. From 1980s to 2000, total ecosystem services decreased firstly and then increased, but the value of 2000 was less than that of 1980s in general. And we concluded that there was a good correlative relationship between change of ecosystem services and changes of land use pattern. Decrease of woodland and grassland and landscape fragmentation was the main reason of decrease of ecosystem services.","2153-7003","978-1-4244-1211-2","10.1109/IGARSS.2007.4423565","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4423565","Land Use and Land Cover Change;landscape pattern;ecosystem service function value","Pattern analysis;Ecosystems;Content addressable storage;Humans;Soil;Protection;Resource management;Environmental factors;Degradation;Government","ecology;environmental factors;geophysical techniques;pattern classification;soil;vegetation","land use type spatial pattern change;Wuchuan County;Inner Mongolia Municipality;landscape pattern;China ecosystem service value;grassland;cropland;Woodland;government policy;land use transition matrix;rural area;urbanization process;landscape fragmentation;human activities;soil formation;soil protection;waste treatment;water regulation;AD 1955 to 2000","","","","10","","7 Jan 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
